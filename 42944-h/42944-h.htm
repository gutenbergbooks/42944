<h2><a name="A_RAINY_JUNE" id="A_RAINY_JUNE">A RAINY JUNE</a></h2>

<h3><i>From the Principe di San Zenone, Claridge's, London,
to the Duchessa dell'Aquila Fulva, Monterone, near
Val d'Aosta, Italy.</i></h3>

<p>'<span class="smcap">Carissima Teresa</span>&mdash;I received your letter,
which is delightful to me because it is yours,
and terrible to me because it scolds me, abuses
me, flies at me, makes me feel like a schoolboy
who has had a scolding. Yes; it is quite true.
I cannot help it. She has bewitched me. She
is a lily made into a woman. I feared you
would be angry, especially angry because she is
a foreigner; but the hour of fate has struck.
You will not wonder when you see her. She is
as blonde as the dawn and as pure as a pearl.
It seems to me that I have never loved any
woman at all in my life before. To love her
is like plunging one's hand in cool spring water
on a midsummer noon. She is such repose;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
such innocence; such holiness! In the midst
of this crowded, over-coloured, vulgar London
life&mdash;for it is very vulgar at its highest&mdash;she
seems like some angel of purity. I saw her
first standing with a knot of roses in her hand
under a cedar tree, at one of their afternoon
clubs on the river. She was drinking a cup of
tea; they are always drinking tea. And she
is so white. I never saw anything so white
except the snow on the Leonessa. She is not
in the least like the fast young ladies of England,
of whom one sees so much in the winter
at Rome. I do not like their fast young
women. If you want a woman who is fast,
a Parisienne is best, or even an American.
Englishwomen overdo it. She is just like a
primrose; like a piece of porcelain; like a soft,
pale star shining in the morning. I write all
kinds of poetry when I think of her. And
then, there is something <i>Sainte Nitouche</i> about
her which is delicious, because it is so real.
The only thing which was wanting in her was
that she ought to have been shut up in a convent,
and I ought to have had to imperil my
soul for all eternity by getting her over a stone
wall with a silken ladder. But it is a prosaic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
age, and this is a very prosaic country.
London amuses me, but it is such a crowd,
and it is frightfully ugly. I cannot think how
people who are so enormously rich as the
English can put up with such ugliness. The
houses are all too small, even the big ones. I
have not seen a good ballroom; they say there
are good ones in the country houses. The
clubs are admirable, but life in general seems to
me hurried, costly, ungraceful, very noisy, and
almost entirely consecrated to eating. It is
made up of a scramble and a mass of food.
People engage themselves for dinners a month
in advance. Everybody's engagement book is
so full that it is the burden of their days.
They accept everything, and, at the eleventh
hour, pick out what they prefer, and, to use
their own language, "throw over" the rest.
I do not think it is pretty behaviour, but
nobody seems to object to it. I wonder that
the women do not do so, but they seem to be
afraid of losing their men altogether if they
exact good manners from them. People here
are not at all well-mannered, to my taste;
neither the men nor the women. They are
brusque and negligent, and have few <i>petits soins</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
You should have come over for my marriage to
show them all what an exquisite creature a
Venetian patrician beauty can be. Why <i>would</i>
you marry that Piedmontese? Only two
things seem to be of any importance in England&mdash;they
are, eating and politics. They eat
all day long, and are always talking of their
politics. Half of them say some person I never
heard of is the destruction of England, the
other half say the same person is the salvation
of England. Myself, I don't care the least
which he is; only I know they cannot keep
him out of their conversation, one way or
another, for five minutes; which, to an unprejudiced
foreigner, is a <i>seccatura</i>. But to-morrow
I go down into the country with my
primrose&mdash;all alone; to-morrow she will be
mine altogether and unalterably, and I shall
hear nothing about their detestable politics or
anything that is tiresome. Of course, you are
wondering that I should take this momentous
step. I wonder myself, but then if I did not
marry I should be compelled to say an eternal
farewell to the Lenten Lily. She has such a
spiked wall around her of male relatives and
family greatness! It is not the convent wall;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
there is no ladder that will go over it; one
must enter by the big front door, or not at all.
Felicitate me, and yet compassionate me! I
am going to Paradise, no doubt; but I have the
uncomfortable doubt as to whether it will suit
me, which all people who are going to Paradise
always do feel. Why? Because we are
mortal or because we are sinners? <i>A
reverderci, cara mia Teresina!</i> Write to me
at my future Eden: it is called Coombe Bysset,
near Luton, Bedfordshire. We are to be there
a month. It is the choice of my primrose.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span></p>

<h3><i>From the Lady Mary Bruton, Belgrave Square, London,
to Mrs d'Arcy, British Embassy, Berlin.</i></h3>

<p>'The season has been horribly dull;
quantities of marriages&mdash;people always will
marry, however dull it is. The one most
talked about is that of the Cowes' second
daughter, Lady Gladys, with the Prince of
San Zenone. She is one of the beauties,
but a very simple girl, quite old-fashioned,
indeed. She has refused Lord Hampshire,
and a good many other people, and then
fallen in love in a week with this Roman,
who is certainly as handsome as a picture.
But Cowes didn't like it at all; he gave
in because he couldn't help it, but he was
dreadfully vexed that the Hampshire affair
did not come off instead. Hampshire is
such a good creature, and his estates are
close to theirs. It is certainly very provoking
for them that this Italian must take it
into his head to spend a season in London,
and lead the cotillon so beautifully that all
the young women talked of nothing else
but his charms.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span></p>

<h3><i>From the Lady Mona St Clair, Grosvenor Square,
London, to Miss Burns, Schooner-yacht Persephone,
off Cherbourg.</i></h3>

<p>'The wedding was very pretty yesterday.
We had frocks of tussore silk, with bouquets
of orchids and Penelope Boothby caps. She
looked as white as her gown&mdash;such a goose!&mdash;it
was ivory satin, with <i>point de Venise</i>.
He is quite too handsome, and I cannot
think what he could see in her! He gave
us each a locket with <i>her</i> portrait inside. I
wished it had been <i>his</i>! I daresay Hampshire
would have been better for her, and worn
longer than Romeo. Lord Cowes is furious
about Romeo. He detests the religion and all
that, and he could hardly make himself look
pleasant even at church. Of course, there were
two ceremonies. The Cardinal had consented
at last, though I believe he had made all kinds
of fuss first. Lady Gladys, you know, is
very, <i>very</i> High Church, and I suppose that reconciled
a little the very irreconcilable Prelate.
She thinks of nothing but the Church and her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
missions and her poor people. I am afraid
the Roman Prince will get dreadfully bored.
And they are going down into Bedfordshire,
of all places, to be shut up for a month! It
is very stupid of her, and such a wet season
as it is! They are going to Coombe Bysset,
her aunt, Lady Caroline's place. I fancy
Romeo will soon be bored, and I don't think
Coombe Bysset at all judicious. I would have
gone to Homburg, or Deauville, or Japan.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span></p>

<h3><i>From the Principessa di San Zenone, Coombe Bysset,
Luton, Beds., to the Countess of Cowes, London.</i></h3>

<p>'<span class="smcap">Dearest Mother</span>,&mdash;I am too, too, too
happy. It is no use writing about it. I would
if I could, but I <i>can't</i>. He is delighted with
Coombe, and says the verdure is something
wonderful. We got here just as the sun was
setting. There were all Aunt Carrie's school
children out to meet us, with baskets of roses.
Piero said they looked like bigger roses themselves.
He is enchanted with our rural
England. It is very fine to-day, and I do
so hope it won't rain, but the glass is falling.
Forgive a hurried word like this. I am going
to take Piero on the lake. I know you haven't
liked it, dear; but I am sure when you see how
happy I am you will say there was never anyone
like him on earth.</p>

<p>'He is an angel. We ride in the morning,
we sing and play in the evening. We adore
each other all the twenty-four hours through.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
I wonder however I could have lived without
him. I am longing to see all he tells me about
his great marble palaces, and his immense
dreamlike villas, and his gardens with their
multitude of statues, and the wonderful light
that is over it all. He protests it is always
twilight with us in England. It seems so
absurd, when nowadays everybody knows
everything about everywhere, that I should
never have been to Italy. But we were such
country mice down at dear, old, dull, green,
muddy Ditchworth. Lanciano, the biggest of
all their big places, must be like a poem. It is
a great house, all of different coloured marbles,
set amidst ilex groves on the mountain side,
with cascades like Terni, and gardens that
were planned by Giulio Romano, and temples
that were there in the days of Horace. I long
to see it all, and yet I hope he will not want
to leave Coombe yet. There is no place like
the place where one is <i>first</i> happy. And somehow,
I fancy I look better in these homely, low
rooms of Aunt Carrie's, with their Chippendale
furniture and their smell of dry rose leaves, than
I shall do in those enormous palaces which want
a Semiramis or a Cleopatra. They were kind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
enough to make a fuss about me in London,
but I never thought much of myself, and I
am afraid I must feel rather dull to Piero,
who is so brilliant himself, and has all kinds
of talents.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span></p>

<h3><i>From the Countess of Cowes, Cowes House, London, to
the Duchess of Dunne, Wavernake, Worcestershire.</i></h3>

<p>'No, I confess I do not approve of the
marriage; it will take her away from us, and
I am afraid she won't be happy. She has
always had such very exaggerated ideas. She
is not in the least the girl of the period. Of
course, she was taken by his picturesque face
and his admirable manners. His manners are
really wonderful in these days, when our men
have none at all; and he has charmingly
caressing and deferential ways which even win
me. I cannot wonder at her, poor child, but
I am afraid; candidly, I am afraid! He
makes all our men look like ploughboys. And
it was all done in such tremendous haste that
she had no time to reason or reflect; and I
don't think they have said two serious words
to each other. If only it had been dear old
Hampshire, whom we have known all our lives,
and whose lands march with ours! But that
was too good to be, I suppose, and there was no
positive objection we could raise to San Zenone.
We could not refuse his proposals merely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
because he is too good-looking, isn't an
Englishman, and has a mother who is reputed
<i>maîtresse femme</i>! Gladys writes from Coombe
as from the seventh heaven. They have been
married three days! But I fear she will have
trouble before her. I fear he is weak and unstable,
and will not back her up amongst his
own people when she goes amongst them;
and though, now-a-days, a man and woman,
once wedded, see so little of each other, Gladys
is not quite of the time in her notions. She
will take it all very seriously, poor child, and
expect the idyl to be prolonged over the
honeymoon. And she is very English in her
tastes, and has been so very little out of
England. However, every girl in London is
envying her; it is only her father and I who
see these little black specks on the fruit she has
plucked. They are gone to Coombe by her
wish. I think it would have been wiser not
to subject an Italian to such an ordeal as a wet
English June in an utterly lonely country
house. You know, even Englishmen, who can
always find such refuge and comfort in prize
pigs and strawyards, and unusually big mangolds,
get bored if they are in the country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
when there is nothing to shoot, and Englishmen
are used to being drenched to the skin
every time they move out. He is not. Lord
Cowes says love is like a cotton frock&mdash;very
pretty as long as the sun shines, but it won't
stand a wetting. I wish you had been here;
Gladys looked quite lovely. The Cardinal
most kindly relented, and the whole thing
went off very well. Of the San Zenone family,
there was only present Don Fabrizio, the
younger son, a very good-looking young man.
The terrible Duchess didn't come, on account,
I think, of her sulks. She hates the marriage
on her side as much as we do on ours, I am
sure. Really, one must believe a little bit
in fate. I do think that Gladys would soon
have resigned herself to accepting Hampshire,
out of sheer fatigue at saying "No," and, besides,
she knew that we are so fond of him, and to
live in the same county was such an attraction.
But this irresistible young Roman must take
it into his head that he wished to see a London
season, and when once they had met (it was one
afternoon at Ranelagh) there was no more chance
for our poor, dear, good, stupid neighbour.
Well, we must hope for the best!'</p>

<h3><i>From the Principe Piero di San Zenone, Coombe Bysset, to
the Duchessa dell'Aquila Fulva, Palazzo Fulva,
Rome.</i></h3>

<p>'<span class="smcap">Carissima Mia</span>,&mdash;There are quantities
of birds in little green nests at this season. I
am in a green nest. I never saw anything so
green as this Paradise of mine. It is certainly
Paradise. If I feel a little like a fish out of
water instead of a happy bird in it, it is only
because I have been such a sinner. No doubt
it is only that. Paradise is chilly; this is its
only fault. It is the sixth of June and we
have fires. Fires in the dressing-rooms, fires
in the drawing-rooms, fires at both ends of
the library, fires on both sides of the hall, fires
everywhere; and with all of them I shiver.
I cannot help shivering, and I feel convinced
that in my rapture I have mistaken the month&mdash;it
must be December! It is all extraordinarily
trim and neat here; the whole
place looks in such perfect order that it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
might have been taken out of a box of
German toys last night. I have a little the
sensation of being always at church. That, no
doubt, is the effect of the first step towards
virtue that I have ever made. Pray do not
think that I am not perfectly happy. I should
be more sensible of my happiness, no doubt,
if I had not quite such a feeling, due to the
dampness of the air, of having been put into
an aquarium, like a jelly-fish. But Gladys is
adorable in every way; and if she were not quite
so easily scared, would be perfection. It was
that little air of hers, like that of some
irresistible Alpine flower, which bewitched
me. But when one has got the Alpine
flower, one cannot live for ever on it!&mdash;however
<i>ma basta</i>! I was curious to know what
a northern woman was like; I know now.
She is exquisite, but a little monotonous, and
a little prudish. Certainly she will never compromise
me; but then, perhaps, she will never
let me compromise myself, and that will be
terrible! I am ungrateful; all men are ungrateful;
but, then, is it not a little the
women's fault? They do keep so very close
to one. Now, an angel, you know, becomes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
tiresome if one never gets out of the shadow of
its wings&mdash;here, at Coombe Bysset, the angel
fills the horizon, and one's distance is a
Botticelli picture!'</p>

<h3><i>From the Duchessa dell'Aquila Fulva, Palazzo Fulva,
Rome, to the Principe Piero di San Zenone, Coombe
Bysset, Luton, Beds., England.</i></h3>

<p>'<span class="smcap">Caro mio Pierino</span>,&mdash;Are you sure you
have an angel? People have a trick of always
calling very commonplace women angels. "She
is an angel" is a polite way of saying "she is a
bore." I am not sure either that I should care
to live with a veritable angel. One would see
too much of the wings, as you say; and even a
guardian angel must be the <i>terzo incommodo</i>
sometimes. Why <i>would</i> you marry an English
girl? I daresay she is so good-tempered that
she never contradicts you, and you grow peevish
out of sheer weariness at having everything your
own way. If you had married Nicoletta, as I
wanted you to do, she would have flown at you,
like a little tigress, a dozen times a week, and
kept you on the <i>qui vive</i> to please her. We
know what our own men want. I have half a
mind to write to your wife and tell her that
no Italian is comfortable unless he has his ears<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
boxed twice a day. If your wife would be a little
disagreeable, probably you would adore her.
But it is a great mistake, <i>Pierino mio</i>, to confuse
marriage and love. In reality, they have no
more to do with one another than a horse chestnut
and a chestnut horse; than the <i>zuccone</i> that
means a vegetable, and the <i>zuccone</i> that means a
simpleton. I should imagine that your wet
English bird's-nest will force you to realise this
truth with lamentable rapidity.'</p>

<h3><i>From the Principessa di San Zenone, Coombe Bysset,
Luton, Beds., to Lady Gwendoline Dormer, British
Embassy, Vienna.</i></h3>

<p>'<span class="smcap">Dearest Gwen</span>,&mdash;I did promise, I know,
to write to you at once, and tell you everything;
and a whole week is gone and I
couldn't do it, I really couldn't; and even
now I don't know where to begin. I
suppose I am dreadfully <i>vieux jeu</i>. I suppose
you will only laugh at me, and say "spoons."
How glad I am Piero cannot say a word
of English, and so I never hear that dreadful
jargon which I do think so ugly and so
vulgar, though you are all so fond of it. I
ought not to have come to Coombe Bysset;
at least, they all said it was silly. Nessie
Fitzgerald was back in London before the
week was out, and doing a play. To be sure
she was married in October, and she didn't
care a bit about him, and I suppose that
made all the difference. To me, it seems
so much more natural to shut one's self<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
up, and Piero thought so too; but I am
half afraid he finds it a little dull now. You
see, we knew very little of one another. He
came for a month of the London season, and
he met me at Ranelagh, and he danced the
cotillon with me at a good many houses, and
we cared for one another in a week, and
were married in a month, as you know.
Papa hated it because it wasn't Lord
Burlington or Lord Hampshire. But he
couldn't really object, because the San Zenone
are such a great Roman family, and all the
world knows them; and they are Spanish
dukes as well as Italian princes. And Piero
is such a grand gentleman, and made quite
superb settlements; much more, Papa said,
than he could have expected, so poor as
we are. But what I meant was, meeting
like that in the rush of the season, at balls
and dinners and garden parties, and luncheons
at Hurlingham, and being married to one
another just before Ascot, we really knew
nothing at all of each other's tastes or habits
or character. And when, on the first morning
at Coombe, we realised that we were together
for life, I think we both felt very odd. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
adored one another, but we didn't know what
to talk about; we never had talked to each
other; we never had time. And I am afraid
there is something of this feeling with him.
I am afraid he is dreadfully bored, and I told
him so, and he answered, "My dear little
angel, your admirable countrymen are not bored
in the country because they are always eating.
They eat a big breakfast, they eat a big
luncheon, they eat a big dinner, they are
always eating. Myself, I have not that
resource. Give me a little coffee and a little
wine, and let me eat only once a day. You
never told me I was expected to absorb continually
food like the crocodiles." What would
he say if he saw a hunting breakfast in the
shires? I suppose life <i>is</i> very material in
England. I think it is why there is so much
typhoid fever. Do you know, he wasn't
going to dress for dinner because we were
alone. As if that was any reason! I told
him it would look so odd to the servants if
he didn't dress, so he has done so since. But
he says it was a <i>seccatura</i> (this means, I believe,
a bore), and he told me we English sacrifice
our whole lives to fuss, form and the outside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
of things. There is a good deal of truth
in this. What numbers of people one knows
who are ever so poor, and who yet, for the
sake of the look of the thing, get into debt
over their ears! And then, quantities of them
go to church for the form of the thing, when
they don't <i>believe</i> one atom; they will tell
you at luncheon that they don't. I fancy
Italians are much more honest than we are
in this sort of way. Piero says if they are
poor, they don't mind saying so, and if they
have no religion, they don't pretend to have
any. He declares we English spoil all our
lives because we fancy it is our duty to pretend
to be something we are not. Now, isn't that
really very true? I am sure you would
delight in all he says. He is so original,
so unconventional; our people think him
ignorant, because he doesn't read, and doesn't
care a straw about politics. But I assure
you he is as clever as anything can be; and
he doesn't get his ideas out of newspapers;
nor repeat like a parrot what his chief of
party tells him. I do wish you could have
come over and could have seen him. It was
so unkind of you to be ill just at the very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
time of my marriage. You know that it is
only to you that I ever say quite what I feel
about things. The girls are too young, and
Mamma doesn't understand. She never could
see why I would not marry poor Hampshire.
She always said that I should care for him
in time. I don't think Mamma can ever
have been in love with anybody. I wonder
what <i>she</i> married for&mdash;don't you?'</p>

<p>'<span class="smcap">Caro Gigi</span>,&mdash;Pray send me all the
French novels you can find, and a case of
Turkish cigarettes. I am in Paradise, but
Paradise is a little dull, and exceedingly damp,
at least in England. Does it always rain in
this country? It has rained here without
stopping for seventeen days and a half. I
produce upon myself the impression of being
one of those larks who sit behind wires on a
little square of wet grass. I should like to
run up to London. I see you have Sarah and
Coquelin and the others; but I suppose it
would be against all the unwritten canons of a
honeymoon. What a strange institution. A
honeymoon! Who first invented it?'</p>

<h3><i>From the Principe di San Zenone, Coombe Bysset, Luton,
Beds., to the Duchessa dell'Aquila Fulva, Palazzo
Fulva, Milano.</i></h3>

<p>'<span class="smcap">Cara Teresina</span>,&mdash;I ought to have
written to you long since, but you know I
am not fond of writing. I really, also, have
nothing to say. Happy the people who have
no history! I am like that people. I was
made happy two weeks ago; I have been
happy ever since. It is slightly monotonous.
How can you vary happiness, except by
quarrelling a little? And then it would not
be happiness any longer. It seems to me
that happiness is like an omelette, best impromptu.</p>

<p>'Do not think that I am ungrateful, however,
either to fate or to the charming innocent who
has become my companion. We have not
two ideas in common. She is lovely to look
at, to caress, to adore; but what to say to
her I confess I have no notion. Love ought
never to have to find dinner-table conversation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
He ought to climb up by a ladder, and get over
a balcony, and, when his ecstasies are ended,
he ought to go the same way. I fancy she
is much better educated than I am, but, as
that would be a discovery fatal to our comfort,
I endeavour not to make it. She is extraordinarily
sweet-tempered: indeed, so much
so, that it makes me angry; it gives one no
excuse for being impatient. She is divine,
exquisite, nymph-like; but, alas, she is a
prude!</p>

<p>'Never was any creature on earth so exquisitely
sensitive, so easily shocked. To live
with her is to walk upon eggshells. Of
course, it is very nice in a wife; very "proper,"
as the English say; but it is not amusing.
It amused me at first, but now it seems to me
a defect. She has brought me down to this
terribly damp and very green place, where it
rains every day and night. There is a
library without novels; there is a cellar
without absinthe; there is a <i>cuisine</i> without
tomatoes, or garlic, or any oil at all; there
is an admirably-ordered establishment, so quiet
that I fancy I am in a penitentiary. There
are some adorably fine horses, and there are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
acres of glasshouses used to grow fruits that
we throw in Italy to the pigs. By the way,
there are also several of our field flowers in
the conservatories. We eat pretty nearly all
day; there is nothing else to do. Outside,
the scenery is oppressively green, the green
of spinach; there is no variety, there are no
ilexes and there are no olives. I understand
now why the English painters give such
staring colours; unless the colours scream,
you don't see them in this aqueous, dim
atmosphere. That is why a benign Providence
has made the landscape a <i>purée aux
epinards</i>.</p>

<p>'I think the air here, inside and out,
must weigh heavily; it lies on one's lungs
like a sponge. I once went down in a
diving-bell when I was a boy; I have the
sensation in this country of being always down
in a diving-bell. The scamp Toniello, whom
you may remember as having played Leporello
to my Don Giovanno ever since we were lads,
amuses himself with making love to all the
pretty maidens in the village; but, then, I
must not do that&mdash;now. They are not very
pretty either. They have very big teeth, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
very long upper lips. Their skins, however,
are admirable. For a horse's skin and a
woman's, there is no land comparable to
England. It is the country of grooming.'</p>

<h3><i>From the Principessa di San Zenone, Coombe Bysset, to Lady
Gwendolen Chichester, British Embassy, Petersburg.</i></h3>

<p>'He laughed at me because I went to church
yesterday, and really I only went because I
thought it <i>right</i>. We have been here a fortnight,
and I have never been to church at all
till yesterday, and you know how very serious
dear Aunt Carrie is. To-day, as it is the
second Sunday I have been here, I thought I
ought to go just once, and I did go; but it
was dreadfully pompous and lonely in the big
red pew, and the villagers stared so, and all the
little girls of the village giggled, and looked
at me from under their sun-bonnets. Dear Mr
Coate preached a sermon on Marriage. It was
very kind of him; but, oh, how I wished he
hadn't! When I got back, Piero was playing
billiards with his servant. I wondered what Mr
Coate would have thought of him. To be sure,
English clergymen have to get used to fast
Sundays now, when the country houses are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
full. It is such a dear little yew walk to the
church from the house here, not twenty yards
long, and all lined with fuchsia. Do you
remember it? Even Piero admits that it is
very pretty, only he says it is a vignette
prettiness, which, I suppose, is true. "You can
see no horizon, only a green wall," he keeps
complaining; and his beautiful, lustrous eyes
look as if they were made to gaze through
endless fields of light. When I asked him
yesterday what he really thought of England,
what do you suppose he said? He said, "<i>Mia
cara</i>, I think it would be a most delightful
country if it had one-fifth of its population,
one-half of its houses, a tithe of its dinners, a
quarter of its machinery, none of its factories,
none of its tramways, and a wholly different
atmosphere!" I suppose this means that he
dislikes it. I think him handsomer than ever.
I sent you his photograph, but that can give
you no idea of him. He is like one of his own
marble statues. We came to Coombe Bysset
directly after the ceremony, and we are here
still. I could stay on for ever. It is so lovely
in these Bedfordshire woods in mid-June. But
I am afraid&mdash;just the very least bit afraid&mdash;that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
Piero may get bored with me&mdash;me&mdash;me&mdash;nothing
but me.</p>

<p>'You know I never was clever, and really&mdash;really&mdash;I
haven't an idea what to talk to him
about when we don't talk about ourselves. And
then the weather provokes him. We have
hardly had one fine day since we came; and
no doubt it seems very grey and chilly to an
Italian. "It cannot be June!" he says a dozen
times a week. And when the whole day is
rainy, as it is very often, for our Junes are such
wet ones nowadays, I can see he gets impatient.
He doesn't care for reading; he is
fond of billiards, but I don't play a good
enough game to be any amusement to him.
And though he sings divinely, as I told you, he
sings as the birds do; only just when the
mood is on him. He does not care about
music as a science in the least. He laughed
when I said so. He declared it was no more
a science than love is. Perhaps love ought to
be a science too, in a way, or else it won't last?
There has been a scandal in the village, caused
by his servant, Toniello. An infuriated father
came up to the house this morning about it. He
is named John Best; he has one of Aunt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
Carrie's biggest farms. He was in such a
dreadful rage, and I had to talk to him, because,
of course, Piero couldn't understand him. Only
when I translated what he said, Piero laughed
till he cried, and offered him a cigarette, and
called him "<i>figlio mio</i>," which only made Mr
John Best purple with fury, and he went away
in a greater rage than he had been in when he
came, swearing he "would do for the Papist."
I have sent for the steward. I am afraid Aunt
Carrie will be terribly annoyed. It has always
been such a model village. Not a public-house
near for six miles, and all the girls such demure,
quiet little maidens. This terrible Roman
valet, with his starry eyes and his mandoline,
and his audacities, has been like Mephistopheles
in the opera to this secluded and innocent little
hamlet. I beg Piero to send him away, but he
looks unutterably reproachful, and declares he
really cannot live without Toniello; and what
can I say?'</p>

If you were only a little older, and ever so
much wiser, you would have telegraphed to the
libraries yourself for the French books; you
would have laughed at them when he laughed,
and instead of taking Mr John Best as a
tragedy, you would have made him into a

Jean Richepin. I begin to think I should have

have married my good, dull George, whom a
perverse destiny has shoved into diplomacy.
Your Roman scandalises you, and my George

<p>'Of course you do not, because you are a

your ideal, your universe. But <i>you</i> are only
one out of the many women who have pleased
him, and attached to the pleasure you afford
him is the very uncomfortable conviction that
he will never be able to get away from you.
My dear child, I have no patience with any
woman when she says, "He does not love me."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
If he does not, it is probably the woman's fault.
Probably she has worried him. Love dies
directly it is worried, quite naturally. Poor
Gladys! You were always such a good child;
you were always devoted to your old women,
and your queer little orphans, and your pet
cripples, and your East-End missions. It certainly
is hard that you should have fallen into
the hands of a soulless Italian, who reads naughty
novels all day long and sighs for the flesh-pots
of Egypt! But, my child, in reason's name,
what did you expect? Did you think that all
in a moment he would sigh to hear Canon
Farrar; the excellent vicar's sermons; take
his guitar to a village concert, and teach Italian
to the lodge-keeper's children? Be reasonable,
and let your poor caged bird fly out of Coombe
Bysset; which will certainly be your worst
enemy if you shut him up in it much longer.'</p>

<h3><i>From the Principe di San Zenone, Coombe Bysset, to the
Duchessa dell'Aquila Fulva, Monterone, Val
d'Aosta.</i></h3>

<p>'I am still in my box of wet moss. I have
been in it two weeks, four days, and eleven
hours, by the calendar and the clocks. I have
read all my novels. I have spelled through my
<i class="pub">Figaro</i>, from the title to the printer's address,
every morning. I have smoked twenty
cigarettes every twenty minutes, and I have
yawned as many times. This is Paradise, I
know it; I tell myself so; but still I cannot
help it&mdash;I yawn. There is a pale, watery sun,
which shines fitfully. There is a quantity of
soaked hay, which they are going to dry by
machinery. There is a great variety of muddy
lanes in which to ride. There is a post-office
seven miles off, and a telegraph station fifteen
miles further off. The <i>ensemble</i> is not
animated. When you go out you see very
sleek cattle, very white sheep, very fat children.
You may meet, at intervals, labouring people,
very round shouldered and very sulky. You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
also meet, if you are in luck's way, with a
traction engine; and wherever you look you
perceive a church steeple. It is all very harmless,
except the traction engine; but it is not
animated or enlivening. You will not wonder
that I soon came to the end of my French
novels. The French novels have enabled me to
discover that my angel is very easily ruffled. In
fact, she is that touchy thing&mdash;a saint. I had
no idea that she was a saint when I saw her
drinking her cup of tea in that garden on the
Thames. True, she had her lovely little serene,
holy, <i>noli me tangere</i> air, but I thought that
would pass; it does not pass. And when I
wanted her to laugh with me at Gyp's '<i class="pub">Autour
du Mariage</i>', she blushed up to the eyes, and
was offended. What am I to do? I am no
saint. I cannot pretend to be one. I am not
worse than other men, but I like to amuse
myself. I cannot go through life singing a
<i>miserere</i>. I am afraid we shall quarrel. You
think that very wholesome. But there are
quarrels and quarrels. Some clear the air like
thunderstorms. Ours are little irritating
differences which end in her bursting into
tears, and in myself looking ridiculous and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
feeling a brute. She has cried quite a number
of times in the last fortnight. I daresay if she
went into a rage, as you justly say Nicoletta
would do, and you might have added you
have done, it would rouse me, and I should
be ready to strike her, and should end in
covering her with kisses. But she only turns
her eyes on me like a dying fawn, bursts into
tears, and goes out of the room. Then she
comes in again&mdash;to dinner, perhaps, or to that
odd ceremony, five o'clock tea&mdash;with her little
sad, stiff, reproachful air as of a martyr;
answers meekly, and makes me again feel a
brute. The English sulk a long time, I think.
We are at daggers drawn one moment, but then
we kiss and forget the next. We are more
passionate, but we are more amiable. I want
to get away, to go to Paris, Homburg,
Trouville, anywhere; but I dare not propose
it. I only drop adroit hints. If I should die
of <i>ennui</i>, and be buried under the wet moss
for ever, weep for me.'</p>

<h3><i>From the Principessa di San Zenone, Coombe Bysset, to

<p>'Coombe is quite too lovely now. It does
rain sometimes, certainly, but between the
showers it is so delicious. I asked Piero to
come out and hear the nightingale; there really
is one in the home wood, and he laughed at the
idea. He said, "We have hundreds of nightingales
shouting all day and all night at Lanciano.
We don't think about them, we eat them in
<i>pasta</i>; they are very good." Fancy eating a
nightingale! You might as well eat Romeo
and Juliet. Piero has got a number of French
books from London, and he lies about on the
couches and reads them. He wants me to
listen to naughty bits of fun out of them, but
I will not, and then he calls me a prude, and
gets angry. I don't see why he shouldn't
laugh as much as he likes himself without
telling me why he laughed. I dislike that
sort of thing. I am horribly afraid I shall
care for nothing but him all my life, while
he&mdash;he yawned yesterday! Papa said to me,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
before we were married, "My dear little girl,
San Zenone put on such a lot of steam at first,
he'll be obliged to ease his pace after a bit.
Don't be vexed if you find the thing cooling!"
Now, Papa speaks so oddly; always that sort
of floundering, bald metaphor, you remember
it; but I knew what he meant. Nobody
could <i>go on</i> being such a lover as Piero was.
Ah, dear, is it in the past already? No, I
don't quite mean that. He is Romeo still very
often, and he sings me the divinest love songs,
lying at my feet on cushions in the moonlight.
But it is not quite the same thing as it was at
first. He found fault with one of my gowns
this morning, and said I don't know how <i>de
me faire valoir</i>. I am terribly frightened lest
Coombe has bored him too much. I would
come here. I wanted to be utterly out of the
world, and so did he; and I'm sure there isn't
a lover's nest anywhere comparable to Coombe
in midsummer. You remember the rose
garden, and the lime avenues, and the chapel
ruins by the little lake? When Aunt Carrie
offered it to us for this June I was so delighted,
but now I am half afraid the choice of it was
a mistake, and that he does not know what to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
do with himself. He is <i>dépaysé</i>. I cried a
little yesterday; it was too silly, but I couldn't
help it. He laughed at me, but he got a little
angry. "<i>Enfin que veux tu?</i>" he said impatiently;
"<i>je suis à toi, bien à toi, beaucoup
trop à toi!</i>" He seemed to me to regret being
mine. I told him so; he was more angry.
It was, I suppose, what you would call a scene.
In five minutes he was penitent, and caressed
me as only he can do; and the sun came out,
and we went into the woods and heard the
nightingale; but the remembrance of it alarms
me. If he can say as much as this in a month,
what can he say in a year? I do not think I
am silly. I had two London seasons, and all
those country houses show one the world. I
know people, when they are married, are
always glad to get away from one another&mdash;they
are always flirting with other people.
But I should be miserable if I thought it
would ever be like that with Piero and me.
I worship his very shadow, and he does&mdash;or he
did&mdash;worship mine. Why should that change?
Why should it not go on for ever, as it does
in poems? If it can't, why doesn't one die?'</p>

<h3><i>From the Lady Gwendolen Chichester, S. Petersburg, to
the Principessa di San Zenone, Coombe Bysset.</i></h3>

<p>'What a goose you are, you dearest Gladys!
You were always like that. To all you have
said I can only reply, <i>connu</i>. When girls are
romantic (and you always were, though it was
quite gone out ages before our time), they
always expect husbands to remain lovers.
Now, my pet, you might just as well expect
hay to remain grass. Papa was quite right.
When there is such a lot of steam on, it must
go off by degrees. I am afraid, too, you have
begun with the passion, and the rapture, and
the mutual adoration, and all the rest of it,
which is <i>quite, quite gone out</i>. People don't
feel in that sort of way nowadays. Nobody
cares much; a sort of good-humoured liking
is the utmost one sees. But you were always
such a goose! And now you must marry an
Italian, and expect it all to be balconies and
guitars and moonlight for ever and ever. I
think it quite natural he should want to get
to Paris. You should never have taken him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
to Coombe. I do remember the rose gardens,
and the lime avenues, and the ruins; and I
remember being sent down there when I had
too strong a flirtation with Philip Rous, who
was in F.&nbsp;O., and had nothing a year. You
were a baby then, and I remember that I was
bored to the very brink of suicide; that I have
detested the smell of a lime tree ever since. I
can sympathise with the Prince, if he longs to
get away. There can't be anything for him to
do, all day long, except smoke. The photo
of him is wonderfully handsome, but can you
live all your life, my dear, on a profile?'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span></p>

<h3><i>From the Principessa di San Zenone, Coombe Bysset, to the
Lady Gwendolen Chichester, S. Petersburg.</i></h3>

<p>'Because almost all Englishmen have snub
noses, Englishwomen always think there is
something immoral and delusive about a good
profile. At all events, you will admit that
the latter is the more agreeable object of contemplation.
It still rains, rains dreadfully.
The meadows are soaked, and they can't get
the hay in, and we can't get out of the house.
Piero does smoke, and he does yawn. He has
been looking in the library for a French novel,
but there is nothing except Mrs Craven's
goody-goody books, and a boy's tale by Jules
Verne. I am afraid you and Mamma are right.
Coombe, in a wet June, is not the place for a
Roman who knows his Paris by heart, and
doesn't like the country anywhere. We seem
to do nothing but eat. I put on an ulster and
high boots, and I don't mind the rain a bit;
but he screams when he sees me in an ulster.
"You have no more figure in that thing than
if you were a Bologna sausage," he says to me;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
and certainly ulsters are very ugly. But I had
a delicious fortnight with the Duchess in a
driving tour in Westmeath. We only took
our ulsters with us, and it poured all the time,
and we stayed in bed in the little inns while our
things dried, and it was immense fun; the
Duke drove us. But Piero would not like
that sort of thing. He is like a cat about
rain. He likes to shut the house up early,
and have the electric light lit, and forget that
it is all slop and mist outside. He declares
that we have made a mistake in the calendar,
and that it is November, not June. I change
my gowns three times a day, just as if there
were a large house party, but I feel I look
awfully monotonous to him. I am afraid I
never was amusing. I always envy those
women who are all <i>chic</i> and "go," who can
make men laugh so at rubbish. They seem
to carry about with them a sort of exhilarating
ether. I don't think they are the best sort
of women, but they do so amuse the men. I
would give twenty years of my life if I could
amuse Piero. He adores me, but that is
another thing. That does not prevent him
shaking the barometer and yawning. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
seems happiest when he is talking Italian with
his servant, Toniello. Toniello is allowed
to play billiards with him sometimes. He is
a very gay, merry, saucy, brown-eyed Roman.
He has made all the maids in the house, and
all the farmers' daughters round Coombe,
in love with him, and I told you how he had
scandalised one of the best tenants, Mr John
Best. The Bedford rustics all vow vengeance
against him, but he twangs his mandoline, and
sings away at the top of his voice, and doesn't
care a straw that the butler loathes him, the
house steward abhors him, the grooms would
horsewhip him if they dare, and the young
farmers audibly threaten to duck him in the
pond. Toniello is very fond of his master, but
he does not extend his allegiance to me. Do
you remember Mrs Stevens, Aunt Caroline's
model housekeeper? You should see her face
when she chances to hear Piero laughing and
talking with Toniello. I think she believes
that the end of the world has come. Piero
calls Toniello "<i>figliolo mio</i>" and "<i>caro mio</i>," just
as if they were cousins or brothers. It appears
this is the Italian way. They are very proud
in their own fashion, but it isn't our fashion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
However, I am glad the man is there when I
hear the click of the billiard balls, and the
splash of the raindrops on the window panes.
"We have been here just three weeks. <i>Dio!</i>
It seems three years," Piero said, when I
reminded him of it this morning. For me,
I don't know whether it is like a single day's
dream or a whole eternity. You know what I
mean. But I wish&mdash;I wish&mdash;it seemed either
the day's dream or the eternity of Paradise to
him! I daresay it is all my fault in coming to
these quiet, bay-windowed, Queen Anne rooms,
and the old-fashioned servants, and the dreary
look-out over the drenched hay-fields. But the
sun does come out sometimes, and then the wet
roses smell so sweet, and the wet lime blossoms
glisten in the light, and the larks sing overhead,
and the woods are so green and so fresh. Still,
I don't think he likes it even then, it is all too
moist, too windy, too dim for him. When I
put a rose in his button-hole this morning, it
shook the drops over him, and he said, "<i>Mais
quel pays!&mdash;même une fleur c'est une douche d'eau
froide!</i>" Last month, if I had put a dandelion
in his coat, he would have sworn it had the
odour of the magnolia and the beauty of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
orchid! It is just twenty-two days ago since
we came here, and for the first four or five days,
he never cared whether it rained or not; he
only cared to lie at my feet, really, literally.
We were all in all to each other, just like
Cupid and Psyche. And now&mdash;he will play
billiards with Toniello to pass the time, and
he is longing for his <i>petits théâtres</i>! Is it my
fault? I torment myself with a thousand self-accusations.
Is it possible I can have been
tiresome, dull, over-exacting? Is it possible
he can be disappointed in me?'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span></p>

<h3><i>From the Lady Gwendolen Chichester, S. Petersburg, to
the Principessa di San Zenone, Coombe Bysset.</i></h3>

<p>'No, it isn't your fault, you dear little
donkey; it is only the natural sequence of
things. Men are always like that when the
woman loves them; when she don't, they
behave much better. My dear, this is just
what is so annoying about love; the man's is
always going slower and slower towards a dead
stop, as the woman's is "coaling" and getting
steam up. I borrow Papa's admirably accurate
metaphor, nothing can be truer. It is
a great pity, but I suppose the fault is Nature's.
<i>Entre nous</i>, I don't think Nature ever contemplated
marriage, any more than she did
crinolettes, pearl powder, or the electric light.
There is no doubt that Nature intended to adjust
the thing on the butterfly and buttercup
system; on the <i>je reste, tu t'en vas</i>, principle.
And nothing would be easier or nicer, only
there are children and poverty. So the butterfly
has to be pinned down by the buttercup.
That is why the Communists and Anarchists<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
always abolish Property and Marriage together.
The one is evolved out of the other, just as
the dear scientists say the horse was evolved out
of a bird, which I never can see makes the
matter any easier of comprehension; but, still&mdash;what
was I saying? Oh, I meant to say this:
you are only lamenting, as a special defalcation
and disloyalty in San Zenone, what is merely
his unconscious and involuntary and perfectly
natural alteration from a lover into a husband.
The butterfly is beginning to feel the pin,
which has been run through him to stick him
down. It is not your fault, my sweet little
girl; it is the fault, if at all, of the world,
which has decreed that the butterfly, to flirt
legitimately with the buttercup, must suffer the
corking pin. Now, take my advice: the pin is
in, don't worry if he writhe on it a little bit!
It is only what the beloved scientists again call
automatic action. And do try and beat into
your little head the fact that a man may love
you very dearly, and yet yearn a little for the
<i>petits théâtres</i> in the silent recesses of his manly
breast. Of course, I know this sort of rough
awakening from delightful dreams is harder for
you than it is for most, because you began at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
such tremendous altitudes. You had your Ruy
Blas and Petrarca, and the mandoline and the
moonlight, and the love-philtres, all mixed up
in an intoxicating draught. You have naturally
a great deal more disillusion to go through than
if you had married a country squire, or a
Scotch laird, who would never have suggested
any romantic delights. One cannot go near
Heaven without coming down with a crash,
like the poor men in the balloons. You have
been up in your balloon, and you are now
coming down. Ah, my dear, everything depends
on <i>how</i> you come down. You will think
me a monster for saying so, but it will rest so
much in your own hands. You won't believe
it, but it will. If you come down with tact and
good-humour, it will all be right afterwards;
but if you show temper, as men say of their
horses, why, then, the balloon will lie prone, a
torn, empty, useless bag, that will never again
get off the ground. To speak plainly, dear, if
you will receive with resignation and sweetness
the unpleasant discovery that San Zenone is
mortal, you won't be unhappy, and you will
soon get used to it; but if you perpetually fret
about it, you won't alter him, and you will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
both be miserable; or, if not miserable, you
will do something worse; you will each find
your amusement in somebody else. I know
you so well, my poor, pretty Gladys; you want
such an immense quantity of sympathy and
affection, but you won't get it, my dear child.
I quite understand that the Prince looks like
a picture, and he has made life an erotic poem
for you for a month, and the inevitable reaction
which follows seems dull as ditch water, you
would even say as cruel as the grave. But it
is <i>nothing new</i>. Do try and get that well in
your mind. Try, too, and be as light-hearted
as you can. Men hate an unamusable woman.
Make believe to laugh at the French novels,
if you can't really do it; if you don't, dear,
he will go to somebody else who will. Why
do those <i>demi-monde</i> women get such preference
over us? Only because they don't bore their
men. A man would sooner we flung a
champagne glass at his head than cried for
five minutes. We can't fling champagne
glasses; the prejudices of our education are
against it. It is an immense loss to us; we
must make up for it as much as we can by
being as agreeable as we know how to be.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
We shall always be a dozen lengths behind
those others who <i>do</i> fling the glasses. By the
way, you said in one of your earliest notes
that you wondered why our mother ever
married. I am not sufficiently <i>au courant</i>
with pre-historic times to be able to tell you
why, but I can see what she has done since she
did marry. She has always effaced herself
in the very wisest and most prudent manner.
She has never begrudged Papa his Norway
fishing, or his August yachting, though she
knew he could ill afford them. She has never
bored him <i>with</i> herself, or <i>about</i> us. She has
constantly urged him to go away and enjoy
himself, and when he is down with her in the
country she always takes care that all the
women he admires, and all the men who best
amuse him, shall be invited in relays, to
prevent his being dull or feeling teased for
a moment. I am quite sure she has never
cared the least about her own wishes, but has
only studied his. This is what I call being a
clever woman and a good woman. But I fear
such women are as rare as blue roses. Try and
be like her, my dear. She was quite as young
as you are now when she married. But unfortunately,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
in truth, you are a terrible little
egotist. You want to shut up this beautiful
Roman all alone with you in a kind of attitude
of perpetual adoration&mdash;of yourself. That is
what women call affection; you are not alone
in your ideas. Some men submit to this sort
of demand, and go about for ever held tight
in a leash, like unslipped pointers. The
majority&mdash;well, the majority bolt. And I am
sure I should if I were one of them. I do not
think you could complain if your beautiful
Romeo did. I can see you so exactly, with
your pretty, little, grave face, and your eyes
that have such a fatal aptitude for tears, and
your solemn little views about matrimony and
its responsibilities, making yourself quite odious
to this mirthful Apollo of yours, and innocently
believing all the while that you are pleasing
Heaven and saving your own dignity by being
so remarkably unpleasant! Are you <i>very</i>
angry with me? I am afraid so. Myself, I
would much sooner have an unfaithful man
than a dull one; the one may be bored <i>by</i> you,
but the other bores <i>you</i>, which is immeasurably
worse.'</p>

<h3><i>From the Principessa di San Zenone, Coombe Bysset, to the
Lady Gwendolen Chichester, S. Petersburg.</i></h3>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Gwen</span>,&mdash;How can you <i>possibly</i> tell
what Mamma did when she was young? I daresay
she fretted dreadfully. Now, of course, she
has got used to it&mdash;like all other miserable
women. If people marry only to long to be with
other people, what is the use of being married at
all? I said so to Piero, and he answered, very
insolently, "<i>Il n'y a point! Si on le savait!</i>"
He sent for some more dreadful French books,
Gyp's and Richepin's and Gui de Maupassant's,
and he lies about reading them all day long
when he isn't asleep. He is very often asleep
in the daytime. He apologises when he is
found out, but he yawns as he does so. You
say I should amuse him, but I <i>can't</i> amuse him.
He doesn't care for any English news, and he
is beginning to get irritable because I cannot
talk to him in Italian, and he declares my
French detestable, and there is always something
dreadful happening. There has been
such a terrible scene in the village. Four of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
the Coombe Bysset men, two blacksmiths, a
carpenter, and a labourer, have ducked Toniello
in the village pond on account of his attention
to their womenkind; and Toniello, when he
staggered out of the weeds and the slime, drew
his knife on them and stabbed two very badly.
Of course, he has been taken up by the constables,
and the men he hurt moved to the
county hospital. The magistrates are furious
and scandalised; and Piero!&mdash;Piero has nobody
to play billiards with him. When the
magistrates interrogated him about Toniello,
as, of course, they were obliged to do, he got
into a dreadful passion because one of them said
that it was just like a cowardly Italian to carry
a knife and make use of it. Piero absolutely
<i>hissed</i> at the solemn old gentleman who
mumbled this. "And your people," he cried,
"are they so very courageous? Is it better
to beat a man into a jelly, or kick a woman
with nailed boots, as your English mob does?
Where is there anything cowardly? He was
one against four. In my country there is not a
night that goes by without a <i>rissa</i> of that sort,
but nobody takes any notice. The jealous
persons are left to fight it out as best they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
may; after all, it is the women's fault." And
then he said some things that really I cannot
repeat, and it was a mercy that, as he spoke in
the most rapid and furious French, the old
gentleman did not, I think, understand a
syllable. But they saw he was in a passion,
and that scandalised them, because, you know,
English people always think that you should
keep your bad temper for your own people
at home. Meantime, of course, Toniello is
in prison, and I am afraid they won't let us
take him out on bail, because he has hurt one
of the blacksmiths dreadfully. Aunt Carrie's
solicitors are doing what they can for him,
to please me, but I can see they consider it all
<i>peines perdues</i> for a rogue who ought to be
hanged. "And to think," cries Toniello,
"that in my own country I should have all the
populace with me. The very carabineers themselves
would have been with me! <i>Accidente a
tutti quei grulli</i>," which means, "may apoplexy
seize these fools." "They were only the
women's husbands," he adds, with scorn;
"they are well worth making a fuss about,
certainly!" Then Piero consoles him, and
gives him cigarettes, and is obliged to leave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
him sobbing and tearing his hair, and lying
face downward on his bed of sacking. I
thought Piero would not leave the poor fellow
alone in prison, and so I supposed he would
give up all idea of going from here, and so
I began to say to myself, "<i>A quelque chose
malheur est bon.</i>" But to-day, at luncheon,
Piero said "<i>Sai carina!</i> It was bad enough
with Toniello, but without him, I tell you
frankly, I cannot stand any more of it. With
Toniello one could laugh and forget a little.
But now&mdash;<i>anima mia</i>, if you do not wish me
to kill somebody, and be lodged beside Toniello
by your worthy law-givers, you must really let
me go to Trouville." "Alone!" I said; and
I believe it is what he did mean, only the horror
in my voice frightened him from confessing it.
He sighed and got up. "I suppose I shall
never be alone any more," he said impatiently.
"If only men knew what they do when they
marry&mdash;<i>on ne nous prendrait jamais</i>. No&mdash;no.
Of course, I meant that you will, I hope,
consent to come away with me somewhere out
of this intolerable place, which is made up of
fog and green leaves. Let us go to Paris to
begin with; there is not a soul there, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
theatres are <i>en rélache</i>, but it is always
delightful, and then in a week or so we will
go down to Trouville, all the world is there."
I couldn't answer him for crying. Perhaps
that was best, for I am sure I should have
said something wicked, which might have
divided us for ever. And then what would
people have thought?'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span></p>

<h3><i>From the Lady Gwendolen Chichester, S. Petersburg, to
the Principessa di San Zenone, Coombe Bysset.</i></h3>

<p>'<span class="smcap">My poor little Dear</span>,&mdash;Are you already
beginning to be miserable about what people
will think? Then, indeed, your days of joy
are numbered. If I were to write to you
fifty times I could only repeat what I have
always written. You are not wise, and you are
doing everything you ought not to do. <i>Of two
people who are married, there is always one who
has the delusion that he or she is necessary and
delightful to the life of the other. The other
generally thinks just the contrary.</i> The result is
not peace. This gay, charming, handsome son
of Rome has become your entire world, but
don't suppose for a moment, my child, that you
will ever be his. It is not in reason, not in
Nature, that you should be. <i>If</i> you have the
intelligence, the tact, and the forbearance
required, you <i>may</i> become his friend and
counsellor, but I fear you never will have these.
You fret, you weep, and you understand
nothing of the masculine temperament. "I see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
snakes," as the Americans observe; and you
will not have either the coolness or the wisdom
required to scotch a snake, much less to kill
it. Once for all, my poor pet, go cheerfully to
Paris, Trouville, and all the pleasure places
in the world. Affect enjoyment if you feel
it not, and try to remember, beyond everything,
that affection is not to be retained or
revived by either coercion or lamentation. Once
dead, it is not to be awakened by all the
"crooning" of its mourner. It is a corpse, for
ever and aye. Myself, I fail to see how you
could expect a young Italian, who has all the
habits of the great world, and the memories of
his <i>vie de garçon</i>, to be cheerful or contented in
a wet June in an isolated English country
house, with nobody to look at but yourself.
Believe me, my dear child, it is the inordinate
vanity of a woman which makes her imagine
that she can be sufficient for her husband.
Nothing but vanity. The cleverer a woman is,
the more fully she recognises her own insufficiency
for the amusement of a man, and the
more carefully (if she be wise) does she take
care that this deficiency in her shall never be
forced upon his observation. Now, if you shut<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
a man up with you in a country house, with
the rain raining every day, as in Longfellow's
poem, you do force it upon him most conspicuously.
If you were not his wife, I daresay
he would not tire of you, and he might
even prefer a grey sky to a blue one. But as
his wife!&mdash;oh, my dear, why, why don't you
try and understand what a terrible penalty-weight
you carry in the race? Write and tell
me all about it. I shall be anxious. I am so
afraid, my sweet little sister, that you think
love is all moonlight and kisses, and forget that
there are clouds in the sky and quarrels on
earth. May Heaven save you from both.
<i class="abbreviation">P.S.</i>&mdash;Do remember that this same love requires
just as delicate handling as a cobweb does.
If a rough touch break the cobweb, all the
artists in the world can't mend it. There is a
wholesome truth for you. If you prevent his
going to Paris now, he will go in six months'
time, and perhaps, then, he will go without you.
You are not wise, my poor pet; you should
make him feel that you sympathise with his
pleasures, not that you and his pleasures are
enemies. But it is no use to instil
wisdom into you; you are very young,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
and very much in love. You look on all
the natural distractions which he inclines to,
as on so many rivals. So they may be, but
<i>we don't beat our rivals by abusing them</i>. The
really wise way is to tacitly show that we can be
more attractive than they; if we cannot be so,
we may sulk or sigh as we will, we shall be
vanquished by them. You will think me very
preachy-preachy, and, perhaps, you will throw
me in the fire unread; but I must say just one
word more. Dear, you are in love with Love,
but underneath Love there is a real man, and
real men are far from ideal creatures. Now, it
is the real man that you want to consider, to
humour, to study. If the real man be pleased,
Love will take care of himself; whereas if you
bore the real man, Love will fly away. If you
had been wise, my poor pet, I repeat, you
would have found nothing so delightful as Gyp
and Octave de Mirbeau, and you would have
declared that the Paris asphalte excelled all the
English lawns in the world. He does not love
you the less because he wants to be <i>dans le
mouvement</i>, to hear what other men are saying,
and to smoke his cigar amongst his fellow-creatures.'</p>

<h3><i>From the Duchessa dell'Aquila Fulva, Hotel des Roches
Noires, Trouville, France, to the Principe di San
Zenone, Coombe Bysset, Luton, Beds., England.</i></h3>

<p>'Poor flower, in your box of wet moss,
what has become of you? Are you dead, and
dried in your wife's <i>hortus siccus</i>? She would
be quite sure of you <i>then</i>, and I daresay much
happier than if you were set forth in anybody
else's bouquet. I try in vain to imagine you
in that "perfectly proper" atmosphere (is not
that correct English, "perfectly proper"?)
Will you be dreadfully changed when one sees
you again? There is a French proverb which
says that "the years of joy count double." The
days of <i>ennui</i> certainly count for years, and
give us grey hairs before we are five-and-twenty.
But you know I cannot pity you.
You <i>would</i> marry an English girl because she
looked pretty sipping her tea. I told you
beforehand that you would be miserable with
her, once shut up in the country. The episode
of Toniello is enchanting. What people!&mdash;to
put him in prison for a little bit of <i>chiasso</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
like that! You should never have taken his
bright eyes and his mandoline to that doleful
and damp land of precisians. What will they
do with him? And what can you do without
him? The weather here is admirable.
There are numbers of people one knows. It
is really very amusing. I go and dance every
night, and then we play&mdash;usually "bac" or
roulette. Everybody is very merry. We all
talk often of you, and say the <i>De Profundis</i>
over you, my poor Piero. Why did your
cruel destiny make you see a <i>Sainte Nitouche</i>
drinking tea under a lime tree? I suppose
<i>Sainte Nitouche</i> would not permit it, else, why
not exchange the humid greenness of your
matrimonial prison for the Rue des Planches
and the Casino?'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span></p>

<h3><i>From the Principe di San Zenone, Coombe Bysset, to
the Duchessa dell'Aquila Fulva, Trouville.</i></h3>

<p>'<span class="smcap">Carissima Mia</span>,&mdash;I have set light to the
fuse! I have frankly declared that if I do
not get out of this damp and verdant Bastile,
I shall perish of sheer inanition and exhaustion.
The effect of the declaration was
for the moment such, that I hoped, actually
hoped, that she was going to get into a
passion! It would have been so refreshing!
After twenty-six days of dumb acquiescence
and silent tears, it would have been positively
delightful to have had a storm. But, no! For
an instant she looked at me with unspeakable
reproach; the next her dove's eyes filled, she
sighed, she left the room! Do they not say
that feather beds offer an admirable defence
against bullets? I feel like the bullet which
has been fired into the feather bed. The
feather bed is victorious. I see the Rue des
Planches through the perspective of the watery
atmosphere; the Casino seems to smile at me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
from the end of the interminable lime tree
avenue, which is one of the chief beauties of
this house; but, alas! they are both as far
off as if Trouville were in the moon. What
could they do to me if I came alone? Do
you know what they could do? I have not
the remotest idea, but I imagine something
frightful. They shut up their public-houses
by force, and their dancing places. Perhaps
they would shut up me. In England, they
have a great belief in creating virtue by Act
of Parliament. In myself, this enforced virtue
creates such a revolt that I shall <i>tirer sur le
mors</i>, and fly before very long. The admired
excellence of this beautiful estate is that it
lies in a ring-fence. I feel that I shall take
a leap over that ring-fence. Do not mistake
me, <i>cara mia Teresina</i>, I am exceedingly fond
of my wife. I think her quite lovely, simple,
saintly, and truly womanlike. She is exquisitely
pretty, and entirely without vanity,
and I am certain she is immeasurably my
superior morally, and possibly mentally too.
But&mdash;there is always such a long and melancholy
"but" attached to marriage&mdash;she does
not amuse me in the least. She is always the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
same. She is shocked at nearly everything
that is natural or diverting. She thinks me
unmanly because I dislike rain. She buttons
about her a hideous, straight, waterproof garment,
and walks out in a deluge. She blushes
if I try to make her laugh at <i class="pub">Figaro</i>, and she
goes out of the room when I mention
Trouville. What am I to do with a woman
like this? It is an admirable type, no doubt.
Possibly if she had not shut me up in a
country-house in a wet June, with the
thermometer at 10 R., and the barometer
fixedly at the word <i>Rainy</i>, I might have been
always charmed with this S. Dorothea-like
attitude, and never have found out the
monotony of it. But, as it is&mdash;I yawn till I
dislocate my neck. She thinks me a heathen
already. I am convinced that very soon she
will think me a brute. And I am neither.
I only want to get out, like the bird in the
cage. It is a worn simile, but it is such a
true one!'</p>

<p>'<span class="smcap">Piero Mio</span>,&mdash;In marriage, the male bird is
always wanting to get out when the female
bird does not want him to get out; also, she is
for ever tightening the wires over his head, and
declaring that nothing can be more delightful
than the perch which she sits on herself. Come
to us here. There are any quantities of birds
here who ought to be in their cages, but are not,
and manage to enjoy themselves <i>quand même</i>. If
only you had married Nicoletta! She might
have torn your hair occasionally, but she would
never have bored you. There is only one
supreme art necessary for a woman: it is to
thoroughly understand that she must never be
a <i>seccatura</i>. A woman may be beautiful,
admirable, a paragon of virtue, a marvel of
intellect, but if she be a <i>seccatura&mdash;addio</i>!
Whereas, she may be plain, small, nothing to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
look at in any way, and a very monster of sins,
big and little, but if she know how to amuse
your dull sex, she is mistress of you all. It
is evident that this great art is not studied at
Coombe Bysset.'</p>

<h3><i>From the Principessa di San Zenone, Coombe Bysset, to
the Lady Gwendolen Chichester, S. Petersburg.</i></h3>

<p>'<span class="smcap">Oh, my dear Gwen</span>,&mdash;It is too dreadful,
and I am so utterly wretched. I cannot tell
you what I feel. He is quite determined to
go to Trouville by Paris at once, and just
now it is such exquisite weather. It has only
rained three times this week, and the whole
place is literally a bower of roses of every kind.
He has been very restless the last few days, and
at last, yesterday, after dinner, he said straight
out, that he had had enough of Coombe, and
he thought we might be seen at Homburg or
Trouville next week. And he pretended to
want every kind of thing that is to be bought
at Paris and nowhere else. Paris&mdash;when we
have been together just twenty-nine days to-day!
Paris&mdash;I don't know why, but I feel as if
it would be the end of everything! Paris&mdash;we
shall dine at restaurants; we shall stay at the
Bristol; we shall go to theatres; he will be at
his club, he belongs to the Petit Cercle and
the Mirliton; we shall be just like anybody<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
else; just like all the million and one married
people who are always in a crowd! To take
one's new-born happiness to an hotel! It is
as profane as it would be to say your prayers on
the top of a drag. To me, it is quite horrible.
And it will be put in <i>Galignani</i> directly, of
course, that the "Prince and Princess San
Zenone have arrived at the Hotel Bristol."
And then, all the pretty women who tried to
flirt with him before will laugh, and say:
"There, you see, she has bored him already."
Everybody will say so, for they all know I
wished to spend the whole summer at Coombe.
If he would only go to his own country I would
not say a word. I am really longing to see his
people, and his palaces, and the wonderful
gardens with their statues and their ilex
woods, and the temples that are as old as the
days of Augustus, and the fire-flies and the
magnolia groves, and the peasants who are
always singing. But he won't go there. He
says it is a <i>seccatura</i>. Everything is a <i>seccatura</i>.
He only likes places where he can meet all
the world. "Paris will be a solitude, too,
never fear," he said, very petulantly; "but there
will be all the <i>petits théâtres</i> and the open-air<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
concerts, and we can dine in the Bois and down
the river, and we can run to Trouville. It will
be better than rain, rain, rain, and nothing to
look at except your amiable aunt's big horses
and big trees. I adore horses, and trees are not
bad if they are planted away from the house, but,
viewed as eternal companions, one may have
too much of them." And I am his eternal
companion, but it seems already I don't count!
I have not said anything. I know one oughtn't.
But Piero saw how it vexed me, and it made him
cross. "<i>Cara mia</i>," he said, "why did you
not tell me before we married that you intended
me to be buried for ever in a box under wet leaves
like a rose that is being sent to the market?
I should have known what to expect, and I do
not like wet leaves." I could not help reminding
him that he had been ever, ever so anxious
to come to Coombe. Then he laughed, but
he was very cross too. "Could I tell, <i>anima
mia</i>," he cried, "that Coombe was situated in a
succession of lagoons, contains not one single
French novel, is seven miles asunder from its
own railway station, and is blessed with a
population of sulky labourers? What man
have I seen since I have been here except your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
parish priest, who mumbles, wears spectacles,
and tries to give me a tract against the Holy
Father? In this country you do not know
what it is to be warm. You do not know
what sunshine is like. You take an umbrella
when you go in the garden. You put on a
waterproof to go and hear one little, shivering
nightingale sing in a wet elder bush. I tell you
I am tired of your country, absolutely tired.
You are an angel. No doubt you are an
angel; but you cannot console me for the
intolerable emptiness of this intolerable life,
where there is nothing on earth to do but to
eat, drink, and sleep, and drive in a dog-cart."
All this he said in one breath, in a flash of
forked lightning, as it were. Now that I
write it down, it does not seem so very dreadful;
but as he, with the most fiery scorn,
the most contemptuous passion, said it, I assure
you it was terrible. It revealed, just as the
flash of lightning would show a gravel pit,
how fearfully bored he has been all the time
I thought he was happy!'</p>

<p>'Where are your principles? Where are
your duties? My dear little girl, you have
married him; you must submit to him as he
is. Marriages wouldn't last two days if, just
because the man yawned, the woman ran away.
Men always yawn when they are alone with
their wives. Hitherto, all San Zenone's faults
appear to consist in the very pardonable fact
that, being an Italian, he is not alive to the
charms of bucolic England in rainy weather,
and that, being a young man, he wants to see
his Paris again. Neither of these seem to me
irreparable crimes. Go to Paris and try to
enjoy yourself. After all, if his profile be so
beautiful, you ought to be sufficiently happy
in gazing at it from the back of a <i>baignoir</i>. I
grant that it is not the highest amatory ideal&mdash;to
rush about the boulevards in a daument,
and eat delicious little dinners in the cafés,
and laugh at naughty little plays afterwards;
but <i>l'amour peut se nicher</i> anywhere. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
Love won't be any the worse for having his
digestion studied by good cooks, and his
possible <i>ennui</i> exorcised by good players. You
see for yourself that the great passion yawns
after a time. Turn back to what you call my
cynical letter, and re-read my remarks upon
Nature. By the way, I entirely deny that
they are cynical. On the contrary, I inculcate
on you patience, sweetness of temper, and
adaptability to circumstances; three most
amiable qualities. If I were a cynic, I should
say to you that Marriage is a Mistake, and
two capital letters could hardly emphasise this
melancholy truth sufficiently. But, as there
are men and women, and, as I before observed,
property in the world, nothing better for the
consolidation of rents and freeholds has, as
yet, been discovered. I daresay some Anarchist
in his prison could devise something better, but
they are afraid of trying Anarchism. So we
all jog on in the old routine, vaguely conscious
that we are all blunderers, but indisposed for
such a drastic remedy as would alone cure us.
Just you remark to any lawyer that marriage
is a mistake, as I have said before, and see
what answer you will get. He will certainly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
reply to you that there is no other way of
securing the transmission of property safely.
I confess that this view of wealth makes me,
for one, a most desperate Radical. Only think,
if there were no property we should all be
frisking about in our happy valleys as free and
as merry as little kids. I shouldn't now be
obliged to put on all my war-paint and beads,
like a savage, and go out to a dreadful Court
dinner, four hours long, because George has
a "career," and thinks my suffering advances
it. Oh, you happy child, to have nothing
worse to do than to rattle down the Bois in
a <i>milord</i>, and sup off a <i>matelote</i> by the lake
with your Romeo!'</p>

Mamma seemed to think it was my <i>duty</i> to
do. But my life is over. I shall say farewell
to all happiness when the gates of Coombe
Bysset close upon me. Henceforth we shall

reproach me any longer with being selfish,
nor can he. There is a great friend of his,

<p>'<span class="smcap">My poor Child</span>,&mdash;Has the green-eyed
monster already invaded your gentle soul because
he doesn't show you his own letters? My dear,
no man who was not born a <i>cur</i> would show a
woman's letters to his wife. Surely you wish
your hero to know the A B C of gentle
manners? I am delighted you are going into
the world; but if you only go as "a duty," I am
afraid the results won't be sunshiny. "Duty"
is such a <i>very</i> disagreeable thing. It always
rolls itself up like a hedgehog with all its
prickles out, turning for ever round and round
on the axle of its own self-admiration. If you
go to Trouville (and wherever else you do go)
as a martyr, my dear, you will give the mischievous
Duchess, if she be mischievous, a
terrible advantage over you at starting. If you
mean to be silent, unpleasant, and enwrapped
in a gloomy contemplation of your own merits
and wrongs, don't blame <i>him</i> if he spend his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
time at the Casino with his friend, or somebody
worse. I am quite sure you <i>mean</i> to be unselfish,
and you fancy you are so, and all the rest of it,
quite honestly; but, in real truth, as I told you
before, you are only an egotist. You would
rather keep this unhappy Piero on thorns beside
you, than see him enjoy himself with other
people. Now, I call that shockingly selfish,
and if you go in that spirit to Trouville, he will
soon begin to wish, my dear child, that he had
never had a fancy to come over to a London
season. I can see you so exactly! Too
dignified to be cross, too offended to be
companionable; silent, reproachful, terrible!'</p>

<p>
<i>'15th July.</i><br />
</p>

<p>'... Amongst the new arrivals here
are the San Zenone. You remember my
telling you of their marriage some six weeks
ago. It was quite <i>the</i> marriage of the season.
They really were immensely in love with each
other, but that stupid month down in the
country has done its usual work. In a rainy
June, too! Of course, any poor Cupid would
emerge from his captivity bedraggled, dripping
and disenchanted. She is really very pretty,
quite lovely, indeed; but she looks fretful and
dull; her handsome husband, on the contrary,
is as gay as a lark which has found the door
of its cage wide open one morning. There is
here a great friend of his, a Duchessa dell'Aquila
Fulva. <i>She</i> is very gay, too; she is
always perfectly dressed, and chattering from
morning to night in shrill Italian or voluble
French. She is the cynosure of all eyes as she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
goes to swim in a rose-coloured <i>maillot</i>, with an
orange and gold eastern burnous flung about her
artistically. She has that wonderful Venetian
colouring, which can stand a contrast and glow
of colour which would simply kill any other
woman. She is very tall, and magnificently
made, and yet uncommonly graceful. Last
night she was persuaded to dance a <i>salterello</i>
with San Zenone at the Maison Persane, and it
was marvellous. They are both such handsome
people, and threw such wonderful <i>brio</i>, as they
would call it, into the affair. The poor, little,
pretty Princess, looking as fair and as dull as a
primrose in a shower, sat looking on dismally.
Stupid little thing!&mdash;as if <i>that</i> would do her
any good! A few days ago Lord Hampshire
arrived off here in his yacht. He was present
at the <i>salterello</i>, and as I saw him out in the
gardens afterwards with the neglected one,
sitting beside her in the moonlight, I presume
he was offering her sympathy and consolation.
He is a heavy young fellow, but exceedingly
good-humoured and kind-hearted. <i>He</i> would
have been in Heaven in the wet June at
Coombe Bysset&mdash;but she refused him, silly
little thing! I am quite angry with her; she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
has had her own way and she won't make the
best of that. I met her, and her rejected
admirer, riding together this morning towards
Villerville, while the beautiful Prince was
splashing about in the water with his Venetian
friend. I see a great many eventual complications
ahead. Well, they will all be the fault
of that Rainy June!'</p>

<h2><a name="DON_GESUALDO" id="DON_GESUALDO">DON GESUALDO</a></h2>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>It was a day in June.</p>

<p>The crickets were chirping, the lizards were
gliding, the butterflies were flying above the
ripe corn, the reapers were out amongst the
wheat, and the tall stalks were swaying and
falling under the sickle. Through the little
windows of his sacristy, Don Gesualdo, the
young vicar of San Bartolo, in the village of
Marca, looked with wistful eyes at the hill-side
which rose up in front of him, seen
through a frame of cherry-boughs in full fruit.
The hill-side was covered with corn, with
vines, with mulberry trees; the men and
women were at work amongst the trees (it
was the first day of harvest); there was a
blue, happy sky above them all; their voices,
chattering and calling to one another over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
sea of grain, came to his ears gaily and
softened by air and distance. He sighed as
he looked and as he heard. Yet, interrogated,
he would have said that he was happy and
wanted for nothing.</p>

<p>He was a slight, pale man, still almost a
youth, with a delicate face, without colour and
beardless, his eyes were brown and tender and
serious, his mouth was sensitive and sweet.
He was the son of a fisherman away by Bocca
d'Arno, where the river meets the sea, amidst
the cane and cactus brakes which Costa loves
to paint. But who could say what fine, time-filtered,
pure Etruscan, or Latin, blood might
not run in his veins? There is so much of the
classic features and the classic forms amongst the
peasants of Tyrrhene seashores, of Cimbrian
oak woods, of Roman grass plains, of Maremana
marshes.</p>

<p>It was the last day of peace which he was
destined to know in Marca.</p>

<p>He turned from the window with reluctance
and regret, as the old woman, who
served him as housekeeper and church-cleaner
in one, summoned him to his frugal supper.
He could have supped at any hour he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
chosen; there were none to say him nay,
but it was the custom at Marca to sup at
the twenty-third hour, and he was not a
person to violate custom; he would as soon
have thought of spitting on the blessed bread
itself. Habit is a masterful ruler in all
Italian communities. It has always been so.
It is a formula which excuses all things and
sanctifies all things, and to none did it do
so more than to Don Gesualdo. Often he
was not in the least hungry at sunset, often
he grudged sorely the hours spent in breaking
black bread, and eating poor soup, when
Nature was at her fairest, and the skies giving
their finest spectacle to a thankless earth.
Yet never did he fail to meekly answer old
Candida's summons to the humble repast.
To have altered the hour of eating would
have seemed to him irreligious, revolutionary,
altogether impossible.</p>

<p>Candida was a little old woman, burnt
black by the sun, with a whisp of grey
hair fastened on the crown of her head, and
a neater look about her kerchief and her
gown than was usual in Marca, for she was
a woman originally from a northern city.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
She had always been a servant in priests'
houses, and, if the sacristan were ill or away,
knew as well as he where every book, bell,
and candle were kept, and could have said
the offices herself had her sex allowed her.
In tongue she was very sharp, and in secret
was proud of the power she possessed of
making the Vice-Regent of God afraid of her.
The priest was the first man in this parish
of poor folks, and the priest would shrink
like a chidden child if she found out that he
had given his best shirt to a beggar, or had
inadvertently come in with wet boots over the
brick floor, which she had just washed and
sanded. It was the old story of so many
sovereignties. He had power, no doubt, to
bind and loose, to bless and curse, to cleanse,
or refuse to cleanse, the sinful souls of men;
but for all that he was only a stupid, forgetful
baby of a man in his servant's eyes, and she
made him feel the scorn she had for him,
mixed up with a half-motherly, half-scolding
admiration, which saw in him half a child,
half a fool, and maybe she would add in her
own thoughts, a kind of angel.</p>

<p>Don Gesualdo was not wise or learned in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
any way; he had barely been able to acquire
enough knowledge to pass through the examinations
necessary for entrance into the
priesthood. That slender amount of scholarship
was his all; but he was clever enough
for Marca, which had very little brains of its
own, and he did his duty most faithfully, as
far as he saw it, at all times. As for doubts
of any sort as to what that duty was, such
scepticism never could possibly assail him.
His creed appeared as plain and sure to him
as the sun which shone in the heavens, and
his faith was as single-hearted and unswerving
as the devoted soul of a docile sheep dog.</p>

<p>He was of a poetic and retiring nature;
religion had taken entire possession of his life,
and he was as unworldly, as visionary, and as
simple as anyone of the <i>peccarelle di Dio</i> who
dwelt around Francesco d'Assissi. His mother
had been a German servant girl, married out
of a small inn in Pisa, and some qualities of
the dreamy, slow, and serious Teutonic temperament
were in him, all Italian of the western
coast as he was. On such a dual mind the
spiritual side of his creed had obtained intense
power, and the office he filled was to him a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
Heaven-given mission which compelled him
to incessant sacrifice of every earthly appetite
and every selfish thought.</p>

<p>'He is too good to live,' said his old housekeeper.</p>

<p>It was a very simple and monotonous existence
which was led by him in his charge.
There was no kind of change in it for anybody,
unless they went away, and few people
born in Marca ever did that. They were not
forced by climate to be nomads, like the
mountaineers of the Apennines, nor like the
men of the sea-coast and ague-haunted plains.
Marca was a healthy, homely place on the
slope of a hill in a pastoral country, where its
sons and daughters could stay and work all the
year round, if they chose, without risk of
fever worse than such as might be brought
on by too much new wine at close of autumn.</p>

<p>Marca was not pretty, or historical, or
picturesque, or uncommon in any way; there
are five hundred, five thousand villages like
it, standing amongst corn lands and maize
fields and mulberry trees, with its little dark
church, and its white-washed presbytery, and
its dusky, red-tiled houses, and its one great,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
silent, empty villa that used to be a fortified
and stately palace, and now is given over to
the rats and the spiders and the scorpions. A
very quiet, little place, far away from cities
and railways, dusty and uncomely in itself, but
blessed in the abundant light and the divine
landscape which are around it, and of which
no one in it ever thought, except this simple
young priest, Don Gesualdo Brasailo.</p>

<p>Of all natural gifts, a love of natural beauty
surely brings most happiness to the possessor
of it; happiness altogether unalloyed and unpurchasable,
and created by the mere rustle
of green leaves, the mere ripple of brown
waters. It is not an Italian gift at all, nor an
Italian feeling. To an Italian, gas is more
beautiful than sunshine, and a cambric flower
more beautiful than a real one; he usually
thinks the mountains hateful and a city divine;
he detests trees and adores crowds. But there
are exceptions to all rules; there are poetic
natures everywhere, though everywhere they
are rare. Don Gesualdo was the exception in
Marca and its neighbourhood, and evening after
evening saw him in the summer weather
strolling through the fields, his breviary in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
his hand, but his heart with the dancing fire-flies,
the quivering poplar leaves, the tall green
canes, the little silvery fish darting over the
white stones of the shallow river-waters. He
could not have told why he loved to watch
these things; he thought it was because they
reminded him of Bocca d'Arno and the sand-beach
and the cane-brakes; but he did love
them, and they filled him with a vague
emotion; half pleasure and half pain.</p>

<p>His supper over, he went into his church;
a little red-bricked, white-washed passage connected
it with his parlour. The church was
small, and dark, and old; it had an altar-piece,
said to be old, and by a Sienese master,
and of some value, but Gesualdo knew nothing
of these matters. A Raphael might have hung
there and he would have been none the wiser.
He loved the church, ugly and simple as it
was, as a mother loves a plain child or a dull
one because it is hers; and now and then he
preached strange, passionate, pathetic sermons
in it, which none of his people understood,
and which he barely understood himself. He
had a sweet, full, far-reaching voice, with an
accent of singular melancholy in it, and as his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
mystical, romantic, involved phrases passed far
over the heads of his hearers, like a flight of
birds flying high up against the clouds, the
pathos and music in his tones stirred their
hearts vaguely. He was certainly, they thought,
a man whom the saints loved. Candida, sitting
near the altar with her head bowed and her
hands feeling her rosary, would think as she
heard the unintelligible eloquence: 'Dear
Lord, all that power of words, all that skill
of the tongue, and he would put his shirt on
bottom upwards were it not for me!'</p>

<p>There was no office in his church that
evening, but he lingered about it, touching
this thing and the other with tender fingers.
There was always a sweet scent in the little
place; its door usually stood open to the
fields amidst which it was planted, and the
smell of the incense, which century after century
had been burned in it, blended with the
fragrance from primroses, or dog-roses, or new-mown
hay, or crushed ripe grapes, which,
according to the season, came into it from
without. Candida kept it very clean, and the
scorpions and spiders were left so little peace
there by her ever-active broom, that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
betook themselves elsewhere, dear as the wooden
benches and the crannied stones had been to
them for ages.</p>

<p>Since he had come to Marca, nothing of any
kind had happened in it. There had been
some marriages, a great many births, not a
few burials; but that was all. The people who
came to confession at Easter confessed very
common sins; they had stolen this or that,
cheated here, there, and everywhere; got drunk
and quarrelled, nothing more. He would give
them clean bills of spiritual health, and bid
them go in peace and sin no more, quite sure,
as they were sure themselves, that they would
have the self-same sins to tell of the next time
that they should come there.</p>

<p>Everybody in Marca thought a great deal
of their religion, that is, they trusted to it in
a helpless but confident kind of way as a fetish,
which, being duly and carefully propitiated,
would make things all right for them after
death. They would not have missed a mass
to save their lives; that they dozed through
it, and cracked nuts, or took a suck at their
pipe stems when they woke, did not affect
their awed and unchangeable belief in its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
miraculous and saving powers. If they had
been asked what they believed, or why they
believed, they would have scratched their heads
and felt puzzled. Their minds dwelt in a twilight
in which nothing had any distinct form.
The clearest idea ever presented to them was
that of the Madonna: they thought of her
as of some universal mother who wanted to do
them good in the present and future if they
only observed her ceremonials: just as in the
ages gone by, upon these same hill-sides, the
Latin peasant had thought of the great Demeter.</p>

<p>Don Gesualdo himself, despite all the doctrine
which had been instilled into him in his
novitiate, did not know much more than they;
he repeated the words of his offices without any
distinct notion of all that they meant; he had
a vague feeling that all self-denial and self-sacrifice
were thrice blessed, and he tried his
best to save his own soul and the souls of
others; but there he ceased to think; outside
that, speculation lay, and speculation was a
thrice damnable offence. Yet he, being imaginative
and intelligent in a humble and dog-like
way, was at times infinitely distressed to
see how little effect this religion, which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
taught and which they professed, had upon the
lives of his people. His own life was altogether
guided by it. Why could not theirs be the
same? Why did they go on, all through the
year, swearing, cursing, drinking, quarrelling,
lying, stealing? He could not but perceive
that they came to him to confess their peccadilloes,
only that they might pursue them more
completely at their ease. He could not flatter
himself that his ministrations in Marca, which
were now of six years' duration, had made the
village a whit different to what it had been
when he had entered it.</p>

<p>Thinking of this, as he did think of it
continually night and day, being a man of
singularly sensitive conscience, he sat down on
a marble bench near the door and opened his
breviary. The sun was setting behind the
pines on the crest of the hills; the warm orange
light poured across the paved way in front of
the church, through the stems of the cypresses,
which stood before the door, and found its
way over the uneven slates of the stone floor to
his feet. Nightingales were singing somewhere
in the dog-rose hedge beyond the cypress trees.
Lizards ran from crack to crack in the pavement.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
A tendril of honeysuckle came through
a hole in the wall, thrusting its delicate curled
horns of perfume towards him. The whole
entrance was bathed in golden warmth and
light; the body of the church behind him was
quite dark.</p>

<p>He had opened his breviary from habit, but he
did not read; he sat and gazed at the evening
clouds, at the blue hills, at the radiant air, and
listened to the songs of the nightingales in that
dreamy trance which made him look so stupid
in the eyes of his housekeeper and his parishioners,
but which were only the meditations
of a poetic temper, cramped and cooped up in
a narrow and uncongenial existence, and not
educated or free enough to be able even to
analyse what it felt.</p>

<p>'The nightingale's song in June is altogether
unlike its songs of April and May,' thought
this poor priest, whom Nature had made a
poet, and to whom she had given the eyes
which see and the ears which hear. 'The very
phrases are wholly different; the very accent is
not the same; in spring it is all a canticle, like
the songs of Solomon; in midsummer&mdash;what
is it he is singing? Is he lamenting the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
summer? or is it he is only teaching his
young ones how they should sing next year?'</p>

<p>And he fell again to listening to the sweetest
bird that gladdens earth. One nightingale was
patiently repeating his song again and again,
sometimes more slowly, sometimes more
quickly, seeming to lay stress on some
phrases more than on others, and another
voice, fainter and feebler than his own, repeated
the trills and roulades after him fitfully,
and often breaking down altogether.
It was plain that there in the wild-rose hedge
he was teaching his son. Anyone who will
may hear these sweet lessons given under bays
and myrtle, under arbutus and pomegranate,
through all the month of June.</p>

<p>Nightingales in Marca were only regarded as
creatures to be trapped, shot, caged, eaten, sold
for a centime like any other small bird; but
about the church no one touched them; the
people knew that their <i>parocco</i> cared to hear
their songs coming sweetly through the pauses
in the recitatives of the office. Absorbed, as
he was now, in hearkening to the music lesson
amongst the white dog-roses, he started
violently as a shadow fell across the threshold,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
and a voice called to him, 'Good evening, Don
Gesualdo!'</p>

<p>He looked up and saw a woman whom he
knew well, a young woman scarcely indeed
eighteen years old; very handsome, with a
face full of warmth, and colour, and fire, and
tenderness, great flashing eyes which could at
times be as soft as a dog's, and a beautiful
ruddy mouth with teeth as white as a dog's
are also. She was by name Generosa Fè; she
was the wife of Tasso Tassilo, the miller.</p>

<p>In Marca, most of the women by toil and sun
were black as berries by the time they were
twenty, and looked old almost before they
were young; with rough hair and loose forms
and wrinkled skins, and children dragging at
their breasts all the year through. Generosa
was not like them; she did little work; she
had the form of a goddess; she took care of
her beauty, and she had no children, though
she had married at fifteen. She was friends
with Don Gesualdo; they had both come from
the Bocca d'Arno, and it was a link of common
memory and mutual attachment. They liked
to recall how they had each run through the
tall canes and cactus, and waded in the surf,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
and slept in the hot sand, and hidden themselves
for fright when the king's camels had
come towards them, throwing their huge
mis-shapen shadows over the seas of flowering
reeds and rushes and grey spiked aloes.</p>

<p>He remembered her a small child, jumping
about on the sand and laughing at him, a
youth, when he was going to college to study
for entrance into the Church. 'Gesualdino!
Gesualdino!' she had cried. 'A fine priest he
will make for us all to confess to!' And she
had screamed with mirth, her handsome little
face rippling all over with gaiety, like the
waves of the sea with the sunshine.</p>

<p>He had remembered her and had been glad
when Tasso Tassilo, the miller, had gone sixty
miles away for a wife, and had brought her
from Bocca d'Arno to live at the mill on the
small river, which was the sole water which
ran through the village of Marca.</p>

<p>Tasso Tassilo, going on business once to
the sea coast, had chanced to see that handsome
face of hers, and had wooed and won her
without great difficulty; for her people were
poor folk, living by carting sand, and she
herself was tired of her bare legs and face,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
her robust hunger, which made her glad to eat
the fruit off the cactus plants, and her great
beauty, which nobody ever saw except the
seagulls, and carters, and fishers, and cane-cutters,
who were all as poor as she was
herself.</p>

<p>Tasso Tassilo, in his own person, she hated;
an ugly, dry, elderly man, with his soul
wrapped up in his flour-bags and his money-bags;
but he adored her, and let her spend
as she chose on her attire and her ornaments;
and the mill-house was a pleasant place enough,
with its walls painted on the outside with
scriptural subjects, and the willows drooping
over its eaves, and the young men and the
mules loitering about on the land side of it,
and the peasants coming up with corn to
be ground whenever there had been rain in
summer, and so water enough in the river
bed to turn the mill wheels. In drought,
the stream was low and its stones dry, and
no work could be done by the grindstones.
There was then only water enough for the
ducks to paddle in, and the pretty teal to
float in, which they would always do at
sunrise unless the miller let fly a charge of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
small shot amongst them from the windows
under the roof.</p>

<p>'Good evening, Don Gesualdo,' said the
miller's wife now, in the midst of the nightingale's
song and the orange glow from the
sunset.</p>

<p>Gesualdo rose with a smile. He was
always glad to see her; she had something
about her for him of boyhood, of home, of
the sea, and of the careless days before he
became a seminarist. He did not positively
regret that he had entered the priesthood,
but he remembered the earlier life wistfully,
and with wonder that he could ever have
been that light-hearted lad who had run
through the cane-brakes to plunge into the
rolling waters, with all the wide, gay,
sunlit world of sea and sky and river and
shore before him, behind him, and above
him.</p>

<p>'What is wrong, Generosa?' he asked her,
seeing as he looked up that her handsome
face was clouded. Her days were not often
tranquil; her husband was jealous, and she
gave him cause for jealousy. The mill was
a favourite resort of all young men for thirty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
miles around, and unless Tasso Tassilo had
ceased to grind corn he could not have shut
his doors to them.</p>

<p>'It is the old story, Don Gesualdo,' she
answered, leaning against the church porch.
'You know what Tasso is, and what a dog's
life he leads me.'</p>

<p>'You are not always prudent, my daughter,'
said Gesualdo, with a faint smile.</p>

<p>'Who could be always prudent at my
years?' said the miller's young wife. 'Tasso
is a brute, and a fool too. One day he will
drive me out of myself; I tell him so.'</p>

<p>'That is not the way to make him better,'
said Gesualdo. 'I am sorry you do not see
it. The man loves you, and he feels he is
old, and he knows that you do not care;
that knowledge is always like a thorn in his
flesh; he feels you do not care.'</p>

<p>'How should he suppose that I care?' said
Generosa, passionately. 'I hated him always;
he is as old as my father; he expects me to
be shut up like a nun; if he had his own
way I should never stir out of the house.
Does one marry for that?'</p>

<p>'One should marry to do one's duty,' said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
Gesualdo, timidly; for he felt the feebleness
of his counsels and arguments against the
force and the warmth and the self-will of a
woman, conscious of her beauty, and her
power, and her lovers, and moved by all
the instincts of vanity and passion.</p>

<p>'We had a terrible scene an hour ago,'
said Generosa, passing over what she did
not choose to answer. 'It cost me much
not to put a knife into him. It was about
Falko. There was nothing new, but he
thought there was. I fear he will do Falko
mischief one day; he threatened it; it is not
the first time.'</p>

<p>'That is very grave,' said Gesualdo, growing
paler as he heard. 'My daughter, you
are more in error than Tassilo. After all,
he has his rights. Why do you not send
the young man away? He would obey you.'</p>

<p>'He would obey me in anything else, not
in that,' said the woman, with the little
conscious smile of one who knows her own
power. 'He would not go away. Indeed,
why should he go away? He has his employment
here. Why should he go away because
Tasso is a jealous fool?'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
'Is he such a fool?' said Gesualdo, and
he raised his eyes suddenly and looked
straight into hers.</p>

<p>Generosa coloured through her warm, tanned
skin. She was silent.</p>

<p>'It has not gone as far as you think,' she
muttered, after a pause.</p>

<p>'But I will not be accused for nothing,'
she added. 'Tasso shall have what he thinks
he has had. Why would he marry me? He
knew I hated him. We were all very poor
down there by Bocca d'Arno, but we were
gay and happy. Why did he take me
away?'</p>

<p>The tears started to her eyes and rolled
down her hot cheeks. It was the hundredth
time that she had told her sorrows to Gesualdo,
in the confessional and out of it; it was an
old story of which she never tired of the
telling. Her own people were far away by
the seashore, and she had no friends in
Marca, for she was thought a 'foreigner,'
not being of that countryside, and the
women were jealous of her beauty, and of
the idle life which she led in comparison to
theirs, and of the cared-for look of her person.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
Gesualdo seemed a countryman, and a relative
and a friend. She took all her woes to him.
A priest was like a woman, she thought;
only a far safer confidant.</p>

<p>'You are ungrateful, my daughter,' he
said, now, with an effort to be severe in
reprimand. 'You know that you were glad
to marry so rich a man as Tassilo. You
know that your father and mother were glad,
and you yourself likewise. No doubt, the
man is not all that you could wish, but you
owe him something; indeed, you owe him
much. I speak to you now out of my
office, only as a friend. I would entreat you
to send your lover away. If not, there will
be crime, perhaps bloodshed, and the fault
of all that may happen will be yours.'</p>

<p>She gave a gesture, which said that she
cared nothing, whatever might happen. She
was in a headstrong and desperate mood. She
had had a violent quarrel with her husband,
and she loved Falko Melegari, the steward of
the absent noble who owned the empty, half-ruined
palace which stood on the banks of
the river. He was a fair and handsome
young man, with Lombard blood in him;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
tall, slender, vigorous, amorous and light-hearted;
the strongest of contrasts in all
ways to Tasso Tassilo, taciturn, feeble, sullen,
and unlovely, and thrice the years of his
wife.</p>

<p>There was not more than a mile between
the mill-house and the deserted villa. Tassilo
might as well have tried to arrest the sirocco,
or the sea winds when they blew, as prevent
an intercourse so favoured and so facilitated
by circumstances. The steward had a million
reasons in the year to visit the mill, and when
the miller insulted him and forbade him his
doors, the jealous husband had no power to
prevent him from fishing in the waters, from
walking on the bank, from making signals
from the villa terraces, and appointments in
the cane-brakes and the vine-fields. Nothing
could have broken off the intrigue except the
departure of one or other of the lovers from
Marca.</p>

<p>But Falko Melegari would not go away from
a place where his interests and his passions
both combined to hold him; and it never
entered the mind of the miller to take his
wife elsewhere. He had dwelt at the mill all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
the years of his life, and his forefathers for
five generations before him. To change their
residence never occurs to such people as these;
they are fixed, like the cypress trees, in the
ground, and dream no more than they of new
homes. Like the tree, they never change till
the heeder, Death, fells them.</p>

<p>Generosa continued to pour out her woes,
leaning against the pillar of the porch, and
playing with a twig of pomegranate, whose
buds were not more scarlet than her own lips;
and Gesualdo continued to press on her his
good counsels, knowing all the while that he
might as well speak to the swallows under the
church eaves for any benefit that he could
effect. In sole answer to the arguments of
Gesualdo, she retorted in scornful words.</p>

<p>'You may find that duty is enough for you,
because you are a saint,' she added with less
of reverence than of disdain, 'but I am no
saint, and I will not spend all my best days
tied to the side of a sickly and sullen old
man.'</p>

<p>'You are wrong, my daughter,' said Gesualdo,
sternly.</p>

<p>He coloured; he knew not why.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
'I know nothing of these passions,' he
added, with some embarrassment, 'but I know
what duty is, and yours is clear.'</p>

<p>He did not know much of human nature,
and of woman nature nothing; yet he dimly
comprehended that Generosa was now at that
crisis of her life when all the ardours of her
youth, and all the delight in her own power,
combined to render her passionately rebellious
against the cruelties of her fate; when it was
impossible to make duty look other than hateful
to her, and when the very peril and
difficulty which surrounded her love-story
made it the sweeter and more irresistible to
her. She was of a passionate, ardent, careless,
daring temperament, and the dangers of the
intrigue which she pursued had no terrors for
her, whilst the indifference which she had felt
for years for her husband had deepened of late
into hatred.</p>

<p>'One is not a stick nor a stone, nor a
beam of timber nor a block of granite, that
one should be able to live without love all
one's days!' she cried, with passion and contempt.</p>

<p>She threw the blossoms of pomegranate over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
the hedge; she gave him a glance half-contemptuous
and half-compassionate, and left
the church door.</p>

<p>'After all, what should he understand!' she
thought. 'He is a saint, but he is not a man.'</p>

<p>Gesualdo looked after her a moment as she
went over the court-yard, and between the
stems of the cypresses out towards the open
hill-side. The sun had set; there was a rosy
after-glow which bathed her elastic figure in
a carmine light; she had that beautiful walk
which some Italian women have who have
never worn shoes in the first fifteen years of
their lives. The light shone on her dusky
auburn hair, her gold earrings, the slender
column of her throat, her vigorous and voluptuous
form. Gesualdo looked after her, and a
subtle warmth and pain passed through him,
bringing with it a sharp sense of guilt. He
looked away from her, and went within his
church and prayed.</p>

<p>That night Falko Melegari had just alighted
from the saddle of his good grey horse, when
he was told that the <i>Parocco</i> of San Bartolo
was waiting to see him.</p>

<p>The villa had been famous and splendid in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
other days, but it formed now only one of the
many neglected possessions of a gay young
noble, called Ser Baldo by his dependants, who
spent what little money he had in pleasure-places
out of Italy, seldom or never came near
his estates, and accepted, without investigation,
all such statements of accounts as his various
men of business were disposed to send to him.</p>

<p>His steward lived on the ground floor of
the great villa, in the vast frescoed chambers,
with their domed and gilded ceilings, their
sculptured cornices, their carved doors, their
stately couches, with the satin dropping in
shreds, and the pale tapestries wearing away
with the moths and the mice at work in them.
His narrow camp-bed, his deal table and chairs,
were sadly out of place in those once splendid
halls, but he did not think about it; he
vaguely liked the space and the ruined grandeur
about him, and all the thoughts he had were
given to his love, Generosa, the wife of Tasso
Tassilo. From the terraces of the villa he
could see the mill a mile further down the
stream, and he would pass half the short nights
of the summer looking at the distant lights
in it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
He was only five-and-twenty, and he was
passionately in love, with all the increased
ardour of a forbidden passion.</p>

<p>He was fair-haired and blue-eyed, was well
made, and very tall. In character he was
neither better nor worse than most men of his
age; but as a steward he was tolerably honest,
and as a lover he was thoroughly sincere. He
went with a quick step into the central hall
to meet his visitor. He supposed that the
vicar had come about flowers for the feast of
SS. Peter and Paul, which was on the morrow.
Though the villa gardens were wholly
neglected, they were still rich in flowers which
wanted no care&mdash;lilies, lavender, old-fashioned
roses, oleanders red and white, and magnolia
trees.</p>

<p>'Good evening, Reverend Father, you do
me honour,' he said, as he saw Gesualdo. 'Is
there anything that I can do for you? I am
your humble servant.'</p>

<p>Gesualdo looked at him curiously. He had
never noticed the young man before. He had
seen him ride past; he had seen him at mass;
he had spoken to him of the feasts of the
Church; but he had never noticed him. Now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
he looked at him curiously as he answered,
without any preface <span class="locked">whatever,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>'I am come to speak to you of Generosa Fè,
the wife of Tasso Tassilo.'</p>

<p>The young steward coloured violently. He
was astonished and silent.</p>

<p>'She loves you,' said Gesualdo, simply.</p>

<p>Falko Melegari made a gesture as though
he implied that it was not his place either to
deny or to affirm.</p>

<p>'She loves you,' said Gesualdo again.</p>

<p>The young man had that fatuous smile
which unconsciously expresses the consciousness
of conquest. But he was honest in his passion
and ardent in it.</p>

<p>'Not so much as I love her,' he said, rapturously,
forgetful of his hearer.</p>

<p>Gesualdo frowned.</p>

<p>'She is the wife of another man,' he said
with reproof.</p>

<p>Falko Melegari shrugged his shoulders;
that did not seem any reason against it to
him.</p>

<p>'How will it end?' said the priest. The
lover smiled.</p>

<p>'These things always end in one way.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
Gesualdo winced, as though someone had
wounded him.</p>

<p>'I am come to bid you go out of Marca,'
he said simply.</p>

<p>The young man stared at him; then he
laughed angrily.</p>

<p>'Reverend Vicar,' he said impatiently;
'you are the keeper of our souls, no doubt;
but not quite to such a point as that. Has
Tassilo sent you to me, or she?' he added,
with a gleam of suspicion in his eyes.</p>

<p>'No one has sent me.'</p>

<p>'Why then&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Because, if you do not go, there will be
tragedy and misery. Tasso Tassilo is not a
man to make you welcome to his couch. I
have known Generosa since she was a little
child; we were both born on the Bocca d'Arno.
She is of a warm nature, but not a deep one;
and if you go away she will forget. Tassilo
is a rude man and a hard one; he gives her all
she has; he has many claims on her, for in
his way he has been generous and tender. You
are a stranger; you can only ruin her life;
you can with ease find another stewardship far
away in another province; why will you not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
go? If you really loved her you would
go.'</p>

<p>Falko laughed.</p>

<p>'Dear Don Gesualdo, you are a holy man,
but you know nothing of love.'</p>

<p>Gesualdo winced a little again. It was the
second time this had been said to him this
evening.</p>

<p>'Is it love,' he said, after a pause, 'to risk
her murder by her husband? I tell you Tassilo
is not a man to take his dishonour quietly.'</p>

<p>'Who cares what Tassilo does?' said the
young steward, petulantly. 'If he touch a hair
of her head I will make him die a thousand
deaths.'</p>

<p>'All those are mere words,' said Gesualdo.
'You cannot mend one crime by another, and
you cannot protect a woman from her husband's
vengeance. There is only one way by which
to save her from the danger you have dragged
her into. It is for you to go away.'</p>

<p>'I will go away when this house walks a
mile,' said Falko, 'not before. Go away!' he
echoed, in wrath. 'What! run like a mongrel
dog before Tassilo's anger? What! leave her
all alone to curse me as a faithless coward?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
What! go away when all my life and my soul,
and all the light of my eyes is in Marca? Don
Gesualdo, you are a good man, but you are
mad. You must pardon me if I speak roughly.
Your words make me beside myself.'</p>

<p>'Do you believe in no duty, then?'</p>

<p>'I believe in the duty of every honest lover!'
said Falko, with vehemence, 'and that duty is
to do everything that the loved one wishes.
She is bound to a cur; she is unhappy; she
has not even any children to comfort her; she
is like a beautiful flower shut up in a cellar, and
she loves me&mdash;me!&mdash;and you bid me go away!
Don Gesualdo, keep to your Church offices, and
leave the loves of others alone. What should
you know of them? Forgive me, if I am
rude. You are a holy man, but you know
nothing at all of men and women.'</p>

<p>'I do not know much,' said Gesualdo,
meekly.</p>

<p>He was depressed and intimidated. He
was sensible of his own utter ignorance of the
passions of life. This man, nigh his own age,
but so full of vigour, of ardour, of indignation,
of pride in his consciousness that he was beloved,
and of resolve to stay where that love<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
was, be the cost what it would, daunted him
with a sense of power and of triumph such as
he himself could not even comprehend, and yet
wistfully envied. It was sin, no doubt, he said
to himself; and yet it was life, it was strength,
it was virility.</p>

<p>He had come to reprove, to censure, and to
persuade into repentance this headstrong lover,
and he could only stand before him feeble and
oppressed, with a sense of his own ignorance
and childishness. All the stock, trite arguments
which his religious belief supplied him seemed
to fall away and to be of no more use than
empty husks of rotten nuts before the urgency,
the fervour, and the self-will of real life. This
man and woman loved each other, and they
cared for no other fact than this on earth or in
heaven. He left the villa grounds in silence,
with only a gesture of salutation in farewell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span></p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>'Poor innocent, he meant well!' thought the
steward, as he watched the dark, slender form
of the priest pass away through the vines and
mulberry trees. The young man did not
greatly venerate the Church himself, though he
showed himself at mass and sent flowers for the
feast days because it was the custom to do so.
He was, like most young Italians who have
had a smattering of education, very indifferent
on such matters, and inclined to ridicule. He
left them for women and old men. But there
was something about his visitant which touched
him; a simplicity, an unworldliness, a sincerity
which moved his respect; and he knew in his
secret heart that the <i>parocco</i>, as he called him,
was right enough in everything that he had said.</p>

<p>Don Gesualdo himself went on his solitary
way, his buckled shoes dragging wearily over
the dusty grass of the wayside. He had done
no good, and he did not see what good he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
could do. He felt helpless before the force and
speed of an unknown and guilty passion, as he
once felt before a forest fire which he had seen
in the Marches. All his Church books gave
him homilies enough on the sins of the flesh
and the temptings of the devil, but none of
these helped him before the facts of this lawless
and godless love, which seemed to pass high
above his head like a whirlwind. He went on
slowly and dully along the edge of the river-bed;
a sense of something which he had always
missed, which he would miss eternally, was with
him.</p>

<p>It was now quite night. He liked to walk
late at night. All things were so peaceful, or
at the least seemed so. You did not see the
gashes in the lopped trees, the scars in the
burned hill-side, the wounds in the mule's loins,
the bloodshot eyes of the working ox, the
goitered throat of the child rolling in the dust.
Night, kindly friend of dreams, cast her soft
veil over all woes, and made the very dust
seem as a silvered highway to the throne of a
beneficent God.</p>

<p>He went now through the balmy air, the
rustling canes, the low-hanging boughs of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
fruit-laden peach trees, and the sheaves of
cut corn leaning one up against another under
the maples, or the walnut trunks. He
followed the course of the water, a shallow
thread at this season, glistening under the moon
in its bed of shingle and sand. He passed the
mill-house perforce on his homeward way; he
saw the place of the weir, made visible even in
the dark by the lanterns which swung on a cord
stretched from one bank to another, to entice
any such fish as there might still be in the
shallows. The mill-walls stood down into the
water, a strong place built in olden days; the
great black wheels were now perforce at rest;
the mules champed and chafed in their stalls,
inactive, like the mill; for the next three
months there would be nothing to do unless
a storm came and brought a freshet from the
hills. The miller would have the more leisure
to nurse his wrongs, thought Don Gesualdo;
and his heart was troubled. He had never met
with these woes of the passions; they oppressed
and alarmed him.</p>

<p>As he passed the low mill windows, protected
from thieves by their iron gratings, he could
see the interior, lighted as it was by the flame<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
of oil lamps, and through the open lattices he
heard voices, raised high in stormy quarrel,
which seemed to smite the holy stillness of the
night like a blow. The figure of Generosa
stood out against the light which shone behind
her. She was in a paroxysm of rage; her eyes
flashed like the lightnings of the hills, and her
beautiful arms were tossed above her head
in impassioned imprecation. Tasso Tassilo
seemed for the moment to crouch beneath this
rain of flame-like words; his face, on which the
light shone full, was deformed with malignant
and impotent fury, with covetous and jealous
desire; there was no need to hear her words
to know that she was taunting him with her
love for Falko Melegari. Don Gesualdo was
a weak man and physically timid, but here he
hesitated not one instant. He lifted the latch
of the house door and walked straightway into
the mill kitchen.</p>

<p>'In the name of Christ, be silent!' he
said to them, and made the sign of the
cross.</p>

<p>The torrent of words stopped on the lips of
the young woman; the miller scowled and
shrank from the light, and was mute.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
'Is this how you keep your vows to Heaven
and to each other?' said Gesualdo.</p>

<p>A flush of shame came over the face of the
woman; the man drew his hat farther over his
eyes, and went out of the kitchen silently. The
victory had been easier than their monitor had
expected. 'And yet of what use was it?' he
thought. They were silent out of respect for
him. As soon as the restraint of his presence
should be removed they would begin afresh.
Unless he could change their souls it was of
little avail to bridle their lips for an hour.</p>

<p>There was a wild, chafing hatred on one
side, and a tyrannical, covetous, dissatisfied love
on the other. Out of such discordant elements
what peace could come?</p>

<p>Gesualdo shut the wooden shutters of the
windows that others should not see, as he had
seen, into the interior; then he strove to pacify
his old playmate, whose heaving breast and
burning cheeks, and eyes which scorched up in
fire their own tears, spoke of a tempest lulled,
not spent. He spoke with all the wisdom with
which study and the counsels of the Fathers
had supplied him, and with what was sweeter,
and more likely to be efficacious, a true and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
yearning wish to save her from herself. She
was altogether wrong, and he strove to make
her see the danger and the error of her ways.
But he strove in vain. She had one of those
temperaments&mdash;reckless, vehement, pleasure-loving,
ardent, and profoundly selfish&mdash;which
see only their own immediate gain, their own
immediate desires. When he tried to stir her
conscience by speaking of the danger she drew
down on the head of the man she professed to
love, she almost laughed.</p>

<p>'He would be a poor creature,' she said
proudly, 'if all danger would not be dear
to him for me!'</p>

<p>Don Gesualdo looked her full in the eyes.</p>

<p>'You know that this matter must end in
the death of one man or of the other. Do
you mean that this troubles you not one whit?'</p>

<p>'It will not be my fault,' said Generosa, and
he saw in her the woman's lust of vanity
which finds food for its pride in the blood shed
for her, as the tigress does, and even the
gentle hind.</p>

<p>He remained an hour or more with her,
exhausting every argument which his creed
and his sympathy could suggest to him as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
having any possible force in it to sway this
wayward and sin-bound soul; but he knew
that his words were poured on her ear as
uselessly as water on a stone floor. She was
in a manner grateful to him as her friend, in
a manner afraid of that vague majesty of
some unknown power which he represented to
her; but she hated her husband, she adored
her lover;&mdash;he could not stir her from those
two extremes of passion. He left her with
apprehension and a pained sense of his own
impotence. She promised him that she would
provoke Tassilo no more that night, and
this poor promise was all that he could wring
from her. It was late when he left the mill-house.
He feared Candida would be alarmed
at his unusual absence; and hastened, with
trouble on his soul, towards the village, lying
white and lonely underneath the midsummer
moon. He had so little influence, so slender
a power to persuade or warn, to counsel or
command; he felt afraid that he was unworthy
of his calling.</p>

<p>'I should have been better in the cloister,'
he thought sadly; 'I have not the key to
human hearts.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
He went on through a starry world of
fire-flies, making luminous the cut corn, the
long grass, the high hedges, and, entering his
presbytery, crept noiselessly up the stairs to
his chamber, thankful that the voice of his
housekeeper did not cry to him out of the
darkness to know why he had so long tarried.
He slept little that night, and was up, as was
his wont, by daybreak.</p>

<p>It was still dark when the church bell
was clanging above his head for the first
office.</p>

<p>It was the day of Peter and of Paul. Few
people came to the early mass; some peasants
who wanted to have the rest of the day clear;
some women, thrifty housewives who were up
betimes; Candida herself; no others. The
lovely morning light streamed in, cool and
roseate; there were a few lilies and roses on
the altar; some red draperies floated in the
doorway; the nightingales in the wild-rose
hedge sang all the while, their sweet voices
crossing the monotonous Latin recitatives.
The mass was just over, when into the church
from without there arose a strange sound,
shrill and yet hoarse, inarticulate and yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
uproarious; it came from the throats of many
people, all screaming, and shouting, and talking,
and swearing together. The peasants
and the women, who were on their knees,
scrambled to their feet, and rushed to the
door, thinking the earth had opened and the
houses were falling. Gesualdo came down
from the altar and strove to calm them, but
they did not heed him, and he followed them
despite himself. The whole village seemed
out&mdash;man, woman, and child&mdash;the nightingales
grew dumb under their outcry.</p>

<p>'What is it?' asked Gesualdo.</p>

<p>Several voices shouted back to him, 'Tasso
Tassilo has been murdered!'</p>

<p>'Ah!'</p>

<p>Gesualdo gave a low cry, and leaned against
the stem of a cypress tree to save himself
from falling. What use had been his words
that night?</p>

<p>The murdered man had been found lying
under the canes on the wayside not a rood
from the church. A dog smelling at it had
caused the body to be sought out and discovered.
He had been dead but a few
hours; apparently killed by a knife, thrust<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
under his left shoulder, which had struck
straight under his heart. The agitation in
the people was great; the uproar deafening.
Someone had sent for the carabineers, but
their nearest picket was two miles off, and
they had not yet arrived. The dead man
still lay where he had fallen; everyone was
afraid to touch him.</p>

<p>'Does his wife know?' said Don Gesualdo,
in a strange, hoarse voice.</p>

<p>'His wife will not grieve,' said a man in the
crowd, and there was a laugh, subdued by awe,
and the presence of death and of the priest.</p>

<p>The vicar, with a strong shudder of disgust,
held up his hand in horror and reproof, then
bent over the dead body where it lay amongst
the reeds.</p>

<p>'Bring him to the sacristy,' he said, to the
men nearest him. 'He must not lie there like
a beast, unclean, by the roadside; go, fetch a
hurdle, a sheet, anything.'</p>

<p>But no one of them would stir.</p>

<p>'If we touch him they will take us up for
murdering him,' they muttered as one man.</p>

<p>'Cowards! Stand off; I will carry him indoors,'
said the priest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
'You are in full canonicals!' cried Candida,
twitching at his sleeve.</p>

<p>But Don Gesualdo did not heed her. He was
brushing off with a tender hand the flies which
had begun to buzz about the dead man's
mouth. The flies might have stung and eaten
him all the day through for what anyone of
the little crowd would have cared; they would
not have stretched a hand even to drag him
into the shade.</p>

<p>Don Gesualdo was a weakly man; he had
always fasted long and often, and had never
been strong from his birth; but indignation,
compassion, and horror for the moment lent
him a strength not his own. He stooped down
and raised the dead body in his arms, and,
staggering under his burden, he bore it the
few roods which separated the place where it
had fallen from the church and the vicar's
house.</p>

<p>The people looked on open-mouthed with
wonder and awe. 'It is against the law,' they
muttered, but they did not offer active opposition.
The priest, unmolested, save for the
cries of the old housekeeper, carried his load
into his own house and laid it reverently down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
on the couch which stood in the sacristy. He
was exhausted with the great strain and effort;
his limbs shook under him, the sweat poured
off his face, the white silk and golden
embroideries of his cope and stole were stained
with the clotted blood which had fallen from
the wound in the dead man's back. He did
not heed it, nor did he hear the cries of
Candida mourning the disfigured vestments,
nor the loud chattering of the crowd thrusting
itself into the sacristy. He stood looking
down on the poor, dusty, stiffening corpse
before him with blind eyes and thinking in
silent terror, 'Is it her work?'</p>

<p>In his own soul he had no doubt.</p>

<p>Candida plucked once more at his robes.</p>

<p>'The vestments, the vestments! You will
ruin them; take them off&mdash;'</p>

<p>He put her from him with a gesture of
dignity which she had never seen in him, and
motioned the throng back towards the open
door.</p>

<p>'I will watch with him till the guards come,'
he said; 'go, send his wife hither.'</p>

<p>Then he scattered holy water on the dead
body, and kneeled down beside it and prayed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
The crowd thought that he acted strangely.
Why was he so still and cold, and why did he
seem so stunned and stricken? If he had
screamed and raved, and run hither and thither
purposelessly, and let the corpse lie where it was
in the canes, he would have acted naturally in
their estimation. They hung about the doorways,
half afraid, half angered; some of them
went to the mill-house, eager to have the
honour of being the first bearer of such news.</p>

<p>No one was sorry for the dead man, except
some few who were in his debt, and knew that
now they would be obliged to pay, with heavy
interest, what they owed to his successors.</p>

<p>With the grim pathos and dignity which
death imparts to the commonest creature, the
murdered man lay on the bench of the sacristy,
amidst the hubbub and the uproar of the crowding
people; he and the priest the only mute
creatures in the place.</p>

<p>Don Gesualdo kneeled by the dead man in
his blood-stained, sand-stained canonicals; he
was praying with all the soul there was in him,
not for the dead man, but the living woman.</p>

<p>The morning broadened into the warmth of
day. He rose from his knees, and bade his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
sacristan bring linen, and spread it over the
corpse to cheat the flies and the gnats of their
ghastly repast. No men of law came. The
messengers returned. The picket-house had
been closed at dawn and the carabineers were
away. There was nothing to be done but to
wait. The villagers stood or sat about in the
paved court, and in the road under the cypresses.
They seldom had such an event as this in the
dulness of their lives. They brought hunches
of bread and ate as they discoursed of it.</p>

<p>'Will you not break your fast?' said Candida
to Don Gesualdo. 'You will not bring him to
life by starving yourself.'</p>

<p>He made a sign of refusal.</p>

<p>His mouth was parched, his throat felt closed;
he was straining his eyes for the first sight of
Generosa on the white road. 'If she were
guilty she would never come,' he thought, 'to
look on the dead man.'</p>

<p>Soon he saw her coming, with swift feet
and flying skirts and bare head, through the
boles of the cypresses. She was livid; her
unbound hair was streaming behind her.</p>

<p>She had passed a feverish night, locking her
door against her husband, and spending the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
whole weary hours at the casement where she
could see the old grey villa where her lover
dwelt, standing out against the moonlight
amongst its ilex and olive trees. She had had
no sense of the beauty of the night; she had
been only concerned by the fret and fever of
a first love and of a guilty passion.</p>

<p>She was not callous at heart, though wholly
untrained and undisciplined in character, and
her conscience told her that she gave a bad
return to a man who had honestly and generously
adored her, who had been lavish to her
poverty out of his riches, and had never been
unkind until a natural and justified jealousy
had embittered the whole current of his life.
She held the offence of infidelity lightly, yet
her candour compelled her to feel that she
was returning evil for good, and repaying in
a base manner an old man's unwise but
generous affection. She would have hesitated
at nothing that could have united her life to
her lover; yet, in the corner of her soul she
was vaguely conscious that there was a degree
of unfairness and baseness in setting their youth
and their ardour to hoodwink and betray a
feeble and aged creature like Tasso Tassilo.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
She hated him fiercely; he was her jailer, her
tyrant, her keeper. She detested the sound of
his slow step, of his croaking voice, of his
harsh calls to his men and his horses and
mules; the sight of his withered features,
flushed and hot with restless, jealous pains,
was at once absurd and loathsome to her.
Youth has no pity for such woes of age, and
she often mocked him openly and cruelly to his
face. Still, she knew that she did him wrong,
and her conscience had been more stirred
by the vicar's reproof than she had acknowledged.
She was in that wavering mood when
a woman may be saved from an unwise course
by change, travel, movement, and the distractions
of the world; but there were none of
these for the miller's young wife. So long as
her husband lived, so long would she be
doomed to live here, with the roar of the
mill-wheels and the foaming of the weir water
in her ear, and before her eyes the same
thickets of cane, the same fields with their
maples and vines, the same white, dusty road
winding away beyond the poplars, and with
nothing to distract her thoughts, or lull her
mind away from its idolatry of her fair-haired<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
lover at the old grey palace on the hill above
her home.</p>

<p>She had spent the whole night gazing at
the place where he lived. He was not even
there at that moment; he had gone away for
two days to a grain fair in the town of
Vendramino, but she recalled with ecstasy
their meetings by the side of the low green
river, their hours in the wild flowering gardens
of the palace, the lovely evenings when she
had stolen out to see him come through the
maize and canes, the fire-flies all alight about
his footsteps. Sleepless but languid, weary
and yet restless, she had thrown herself on
her bed without taking off her clothes, and in
the dark, as the bells for the first mass had
rung over the shadowy fields, she had, for the
first time, fallen into a heavy sleep, haunted
by dreams of her lover, which made her stretch
her arms to him in the empty air, and murmur
sleeping wild and tender words.</p>

<p>She had been still on her bed, when the
men of the mill had roused her, beating at
the chamber door and crying to her:</p>

<p>'Generosa, Generosa, get up! The master
is murdered, and lying dead at the church!'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
She had been lying dreaming of Falko, and
feeling in memory his kisses on her mouth,
when those screams had come through the stillness
of the early day, breaking through the
music of the blackbirds piping in the cherry
boughs outside her windows.</p>

<p>She had sprung from off her bed; she had
huddled on some decenter clothing, and, bursting
through the detaining hands of the henchmen
and neighbours, had fled as fast as her
trembling limbs could bear her to the church.</p>

<p>'Is it true? Is it true?' she cried, with
white lips, to Gesualdo.</p>

<p>He looked at her with a long, inquiring
regard; then, without a word, he drew the
linen off the dead face of her husband and
pointed to it.</p>

<p>She, strong as a colt, and full of life as a
young tree, fell headlong on the stone floor
in a dead swoon.</p>

<p>The people gathered about the doorway and
watched her suspiciously and without compassion.
There was no one there who did
not believe her to be the murderess. No one
except Don Gesualdo. In that one moment
when he had looked into her eyes, he had felt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
that she was guiltless. He called Candida to
her and left her, and closed the door on the
curious, cruel, staring eyes of the throng
without.</p>

<p>The people murmured. What title had he
more than they to command and direct in this
matter? The murder was a precious feast to
them; why should he defraud them of their
rights?</p>

<p>'He knows she is guilty,' they muttered,
'and he wants to screen her and give her time
to recover herself and to arrange what story
she shall tell.'</p>

<p>In a later time they remembered against the
young vicar all this which he did now.</p>

<p>Soon there came the sound of horses' feet
on the road, and the jingling of chains and
scabbards stirred the morning air; the carabineers
had arrived. Then came also the
syndic and petty officers of the larger village
of Sant' Arturo, where the Communal Municipality
in which Marca was enrolled had its
seat of justice, its tax offices and its schools.
There were a great noise and stir, grinding of
wheels and shouting of orders, vast clouds of
dust and ceaseless din of voices, loud bickerings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
of conflicting authorities at war with one
another, and rabid inquisitiveness and greedy
excitement on all sides.</p>

<p>The feast of SS. Peter and Paul had been a
day of disaster and disorder, but to the good
people of Marca both these were sweet. They
had something to talk of from dawn till dark,
and the blacker the tragedy the merrier wagged
the tongues. The soul of their vicar alone
was sick within him. Since he had seen the
astonished, horrified eyes of the woman Generosa,
he had never once doubted her, but he
felt that her guilt must seem clear as the noonday
to all others. Her disputes with her
husband, and her passion for Falko Melegari,
were facts known to all the village, and who
else had any interest in his death? The whole
of Marca pronounced as with one voice against
her; the women had always hated her for her
superior beauty, and the men had always borne
her a grudge for her saucy disdain of them,
and that way of bearing herself as though a
beggar from Bocca d'Arno were a queen.</p>

<p>'Neighbours put up with her pride while she
was on the sunny side of the street,' said
Candida, with grim satisfaction, 'but now she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
is in the shade they'll fling the stones fast
enough,' and she was ready to fling her own
stone. Generosa had always seemed an impudent
jade to her, coming and talking with
Don Gesualdo, as she did, at all hours, and as
though the church and the sacristy were open
bazaars!</p>

<p>How that day passed, and how he bore himself
through all its functions, he never knew.
It was the dead of night, when he, still dressed,
and unable even to think calmly, clasping his
crucifix in his hands, and pacing to and fro his
narrow chamber with restless and uneven steps,
heard his name called by the voice of a man in
great agitation, and, looking out of his casement,
saw Falko Melegari on his grey horse,
which was covered with foam and sweating as
from a hard gallop.</p>

<p>'Is it true?' he cried, a score of times.</p>

<p>'Yes, it is all true,' said Gesualdo. His
voice was stern and cold; he could not tell
what share this man might not have had in
the crime.</p>

<p>'But she is innocent as that bird in the air,'
screamed her lover, pointing to a scops owl
which was sailing above the cypresses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
Don Gesualdo bowed his head and spread
out his hands, palm downwards, in a gesture,
meaning hopeless doubt.</p>

<p>'I was away at dark into the town to buy
cattle,' said the steward, with sobs in his throat.
'I rode out by the opposite road; I knew
nought of it. Oh, my God, why was I not
here? They should not have taken her without
it costing them hard.'</p>

<p>'You would have done her no good,' said
Don Gesualdo, coldly. 'You have done her
harm enough already,' he added, after a pause.</p>

<p>Falko did not resent the words; the tears
were falling like rain down his cheeks, his hands
were clenched on his saddle-bow, the horse
stretched its foam-flecked neck unheeded.</p>

<p>'Who did it? Who could do it? He had
many enemies. He was a hard man,' he
muttered.</p>

<p>Don Gesualdo gave a gesture of hopeless
doubt and ignorance. He looked down on
the lover's handsome face and head in the
moonlight. There was a strange expression
in his own eyes.</p>

<p>'Curse you for a cold-hearted priest,' thought
the young steward, with bitterness. Then he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
wheeled his horse sharply round, and, without
any other word, rode off towards his home in
the glistening white light, to stable his weary
horse, and to saddle another to ride into the
larger village of Sant' Arturo. It was past
midnight; he could do no good; he could see
no one; but it was a relief to him to be in
movement. He felt that it would choke him
to sit and sup, and sleep, and smoke as usual in
his quiet house amongst the magnolias and the
myrtles, whilst the love of his life lay alone in
her misery.</p>

<p>All gladness, which would at any natural death
of Tasso Tassilo's have filled his soul, was
quenched in the darkness of horror in which
her fate was snatched from him and plunged
into the mystery and the blackness of imputed
crime.</p>

<p>He never actually suspected her for a moment;
but he knew that others would, no doubt, do
more than suspect.</p>

<p>'Perhaps the brute killed himself,' he thought,
'that the blame of the crime might lie on her
and part her from me.'</p>

<p>Then he knew that such a thought was absurd.
Tasso Tassilo had loved his life, loved his mill,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
and his money, and his petty power, and his
possession of his beautiful wife; and besides,
what man could stab himself from behind between
the shoulders? It was just the blow that
a strong yet timid woman would give. As he
walked to and fro on the old terrace, whilst they
saddled the fresh horse, he felt a sickening
shudder run through him. He did not suspect
her. No, not for an instant. And yet there
was a dim, unutterable horror upon him which
veiled the remembered beauty of her face.</p>

<p>The passing of the days which came after this
feast of the two apostles was full of an unspeakable
horror to him, and in the brief space of
them he grew haggard, hollow-cheeked, almost
aged, despite his youth. The dread formalities
and tyrannies of law seized on the quiet village,
and tortured every soul in it; everyone who
had seen or heard or known aught of the dead
man was questioned, tormented, harangued,
examined, suspected. Don Gesualdo himself
was made subject to a searching and oft-repeated
interrogation, and severely reproved that he had
not let the body lie untouched until the arrival
of the officers of justice. He told the exact
truth as far as he knew it, but when questioned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
as to the relations of the murdered man and his
wife, he hesitated, prevaricated, contradicted
himself, and gave the impression to the judicial
authorities that he knew much more against the
wife than he would say. What he tried to do
was to convey to others his own passionate conviction
of the innocence of Generosa, but he
utterly failed in doing this, and his very anxiety
to defend her only created an additional suspicion
against her.</p>

<p>The issue of the preliminary investigation was,
that the wife of Tasso Tassilo, murdered on the
morning of the day of SS. Peter and Paul, was
consigned to prison, to be 'detained as a precaution'
under the lock and key of the law,
circumstantial evidence being held to be strongly
against her as the primary cause, if not the
actual executant, of the murder of her lord.</p>

<p>Everyone called from the village to speak of
her, spoke against her, with the exception of
Falko Melegari, who was known to be her
lover, and whose testimony weighed not a
straw; and Don Gesualdo, himself a priest,
indeed, but the examining judge was no friend
of priests, and would not have believed them on
their oaths, whilst the strong friendship for her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
and the nervous anxiety to shield her, displayed
so unwisely, though so sincerely by him, did
her more harm than good, and made his bias so
visible, that his declarations were held valueless.</p>

<p>'You know I am innocent!' she cried to him,
the day of her arrest; and he answered her with
the tears falling down his cheeks: 'I am sure of
it; I would die to prove it! For one moment
I did doubt you&mdash;pardon me&mdash;but only one.
I am sure you are innocent as I am sure that the
sun hangs in the skies.'</p>

<p>But his unsupported belief availed nothing to
secure that of others; the dominant feeling
amongst the people of Marca was against her,
and in face of that feeling and of the known
jealousy of her which had consumed the latter
days of the dead man, the authorities deemed
that they could do no less than order her provisional
arrest. Her very beauty was a weapon
turned against her. It seemed so natural to her
accusers that so lovely and so young a woman
should have desired to rid herself of a husband,
old, ill-favoured, exacting and unloved. In
vain&mdash;utterly in vain&mdash;did Falko Melegari,
black with rage and beside himself with misery,
swear by every saint in the calendar that his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
relations with her had been hitherto absolutely
innocent. No one believed him.</p>

<p>'You are obliged to say that,' said the judge,
with good-humoured impatience.</p>

<p>'But, God in Heaven, why not, when it is
true?' shouted Falko.</p>

<p>'It is always true when the <i>damo</i> is a man of
honour,' said the ironical judge, with an incredulous,
amused smile.</p>

<p>So, her only defenders utterly discredited, she
paid the penalty of being handsomer and grander
than her neighbours, and was taken to the town
of Vendramino, and there left to lie in prison
until such time as the majesty of the law should
be pleased to decide whether or no it deemed
her guilty of causing the death of her husband.
The people of Marca were content. They only
could not see why the law should take such a
time to doubt and puzzle over a fact which to
them all was as clear as the weather-vane on
their church tower.</p>

<p>'Who should have killed him if not she or
her <i>damo</i>?' they asked, and no one could
answer.</p>

<p>So she was taken away by the men of justice,
and Marca no more saw her handsome head,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
with the silver pins in its coiled hair, leaning
out from the square mill windows, or her
bright-coloured skirts going light as the wind
up the brown sides of the hills, and through
the yellow-blossomed gorse in the warm autumn
air, to some trysting-place under the topmost
pines, where the wild pigeons dwelt in the
boughs above, and the black stoat ran through
the bracken below.</p>

<p>The work of the mill went on the same,
being directed by the brother of Tassilo, who
had always had a share in it, both of labour and
profit. The murder still served for food for
people's tongues through vintage and onward
until the maize harvest and the olive-gathering.
As the nights grew long, and the days cold, it
ceased to be the supreme theme of interest in
Marca; no one ever dreamed that there could
be a doubt of the absent woman's guilt, or said
a good word for her; and no one gave her any
pity for wasting her youth and fretting her soul
out in a prison cell, though they were disposed
to grant that what she had done had been, after
all, perhaps only natural, considering all things.</p>

<p>Her own family were too poor to travel to
her help, indeed, only heard of her misfortunes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
after many days, and then only by chance,
through a travelling hawker. They could do
nothing for her, and did not try. She had
never sent them as much of her husband's
money as they had expected her to do, and now
that she was in trouble she might get out of it
as she could, so they said. She had always
cared for her earrings and breastpins, never
for them; she would see if her jewels would
help her now. When any member of a poor
family marries into riches, the desire to profit
by her marriage is, if ungratified, quickly
turned into hatred of herself. Why should she
have gone to eat stewed kid, and fried lamb,
and hare baked with fennel, when they had
only a bit of salt fish and an onion now and
then?</p>

<p>The authorities at Vendramino had admitted
the vicar of San Bartolo, once or twice, to
visit her, the jailer standing by, but he had
been unable to do more than to weep with her
and assure her of his own perfect belief in her
innocence. The change he found in her
shocked him so greatly that he could scarcely
speak; and he thought to himself, as he saw
how aged and wasted and altered she was, 'If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
she lose her beauty and grow old before her
time, what avail will it be to her even if they
declare her innocent? Her gay lover will look
at her no more.'</p>

<p>Falko Melegari loved her wildly, ardently,
vehemently indeed; but Don Gesualdo, with
that acute penetration which sometimes supplies
in delicate natures that knowledge of the world
which they lack, felt that it was not a love
which had any qualities in it to withstand the
trials of time or the loss of physical charms.
Perchance, Generosa herself felt as much, and
the cruel consciousness of it hurt her more than
her prison bars.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span></p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>The winter passed away, and with February
the corn spread a green carpet everywhere; the
almond trees blossomed on the hill-sides, the
violets opened the ways for the anemones, and
the willows budded beside the water-mill.
There were braying of bugles, twanging of
lutes, cracking of shots, drinking of wines on
the farms and in the village as a rustic celebration
of carnival. Not much of it, for times are
hard and men's hearts heavy in these days, and
the sunlit grace and airy gaiety natural to it
are things for ever dead in Italy, like the ilex
forests and the great gardens that have perished
for ever and aye.</p>

<p>Lent came, with its church bells sounding
in melancholy iteration over the March fields,
where the daffodils were blowing by millions
and the young priest of San Bartolo fasted and
prayed and mortified his flesh in every way
that his creed allowed, and hoped by such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
miseries, pains and penances to attain grace
in heaven, if not on earth, for Generosa in her
misery. All through Lent he wearied the
saints with incessant supplication for her.</p>

<p>Day and night he racked his brain to discover
any evidence as to who the assassin had
been. He never once doubted her; if the
very apostles of his Church had all descended
on earth to witness against her, he would have
cried to them that she was innocent.</p>

<p>The sickening suspicions, the haunting, irrepressible
doubts, which now and then came
over the mind of her lover as he walked to
and fro by the edge of the river at night,
looking up at what had been the casement of
her chamber, did not assail for an instant the
stronger faith of Gesualdo, weak as he was in
body, and, in some ways, weak in character.</p>

<p>The truth might remain in horrid mystery,
in impenetrable darkness, for ever; it would
made no difference to him; he would be
always convinced that she had been innocent.
Had he not known her when she was a little
barefooted child, coming flying through the
shallow green pools and the great yellow grasses
and the sunny cane-brakes of Bocca d'Arno?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
Most innocent, indeed, had been his relations
with the wife of Tassilo, but to him it seemed
that the interest he had taken in her, the
pleasure he had felt in converse with her, had
been criminal. There had been times when
his eyes, which should have only seen in her a
soul to save, had become aware of her mere
bodily beauty, had dwelt on her with an
awakening of carnal admiration. It sufficed to
make him guilty in his own sight. This agony,
which he felt for her, was the sympathy of a
personal affection. He knew it, and his consciousness
of it flung him at the feet of his
crucifix in tortures of conscience.</p>

<p>He knew, too, that he had done her harm
by the incoherence and the reticence of his
testimony, by the mere vehemence with which
he had unwisely striven to affirm an innocence
which he had no power to prove; even by
that natural impulse of humanity which had
moved him to bring her husband's corpse under
the roof of the church and close the door upon
the clamorous and staring throng who saw in
the tragedy but a pastime. He, more than any
other, had helped to cast on her the darkness
of suspicion; he, more than any other, had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
helped to make earthly peace and happiness for
ever denied to her.</p>

<p>Even if they acquitted her in the house of
law yonder, she would be dishonoured for life.
Even her lover, who loved her with all the
sensual, coarse ardour of a young man's uncontrolled
desires, had declared that he would
be ashamed to walk beside her in broad day so
long as this slur of possible, if unproven, crime
were on her. Don Gesualdo mused on all
these things until his sensitive soul began to
take alarm lest it were not a kind of sin to be
so occupied with the fate of one to the neglect
and detriment of others. Candida saw him
growing thinner and more shadow-like every
day with ever-increasing anxiety. To fast, she
knew, was needful above all for a priest in
Lent, but he did not touch what he might
lawfully have eaten; the new-laid eggs and the
crisp lettuces of her providing failed to tempt
him, and no mortal man, she told him, could
live on air and water as he did.</p>

<p>'There should be reason in all piety,' she
said to him, and he assented.</p>

<p>But he did not change his ways, which were
rather those of a monk of the Thebaid than of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
a vicar of a parish. He had the soul in him of
a St Anthony, of a St Francis, and he had been
born too late; the world as it is was too coarse,
and too incredulous, for him, even in a little
rustic primitive village hidden away from the
eyes of men under its millet and its fig trees.</p>

<p>The people of Marca, like his old servant,
noticed the great change in him. Pale he had
always been, but now he was the colour of his
own ivory Christ; taciturn, too, he had always
been, yet he had ever had playful words for
the children, kind words for the aged; these
were silent now. The listless and mechanical
manner with which he went through the offices
of the Church contrasted with the passionate and
despairing cries which seemed to come from his
very soul when he preached, and which vaguely
frightened a rural congregation who were
wholly unable to understand them.</p>

<p>'One would think the good <i>parocco</i> had some
awful sin on his soul,' said a woman to Candida
one evening.</p>

<p>'Nay, nay; he is as pure as a lamb,' said
Candida, twirling her distaff, 'but he was
always helpless and childlike, and too much
taken up with heavenly things&mdash;may the saints<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
forgive me for saying so. He should be in a
monastery along with St Romolo and St
Francis.'</p>

<p>But yet, the housekeeper, though loyalty
itself, was, in her own secret thoughts, not a
little troubled at the change she saw in her
master. She put it down to the score of his
agitation at the peril of Generosa Fè; but
this in itself seemed to her unfitting in one of
his sacred calling. A mere light-o'-love and
saucebox, as she had always herself called the
miller's wife, was wholly unworthy to occupy,
even in pity, the thoughts of so holy a man.</p>

<p>'There could not be a doubt that she had
given that knife-stroke amongst the canes in
the dusk of the dawn of SS. Peter and Paul,'
thought Candida, amongst whose virtues charity
had small place; 'but what had the <i>parocco</i> to
do with it?'</p>

<p>In her rough way, motherly and unmannerly,
she ventured to take her master to task for
taking so much interest in a sinner.</p>

<p>'The people of Marca say you think too
much about that foul business; they do even
whisper that you neglect your holy duties,' she
said to him, as she served the frugal supper of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
cabbage soaked in oil. 'There will always be
crimes as long as the world wags on, but that
is no reason why good souls should put
themselves about over that which they cannot
help.'</p>

<p>Don Gesualdo said nothing, but she saw the
nerves of his mouth quiver.</p>

<p>'I have no business to lecture your reverence
on your duties,' she added, tartly; 'but they
do say that so much anxiety for a guilty woman
is a manner of injustice to innocent souls.'</p>

<p>He struck his closed hand on the table with
concentrated expression of passion.</p>

<p>'How dare you say that she is guilty?' he
cried. 'Who has proved her to be so?'</p>

<p>Candida looked at him with shrewd, suspicious
eyes as she set down the bottle of vinegar.</p>

<p>'I have met with nobody who doubts it,' she
said, cruelly, 'except your reverence and her
lover up yonder at the villa.'</p>

<p>'You are all far too ready to believe evil,'
said Don Gesualdo, with nervous haste; and
he arose and pushed aside the untasted dish and
went out of the house.</p>

<p>'He is beside himself for that jade's sake,'
thought Candida, and after waiting a little while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
to see if he returned, she sat down and ate
the cabbage herself.</p>

<p>Whether there were as many crimes in the
world as flies on the pavement in summer, she
saw no reason why that good food should be
wasted.</p>

<p>After her supper, she took her distaff and
went and sat on the low wall which divided the
church ground from the road, and gossiped
with anyone of the villagers who chanced to
come by. No one was ever too much occupied
not to have leisure to talk in Marca, and the
church wall was a favourite gathering place
for the sunburnt women with faces like leather
under their broad summer hats, or their
woollen winter kerchiefs, who came and went
to and from the fields or the well or the washing
reservoir, with its moss-grown stone tanks
brimming with brown water under a vine-covered
pergola, where the hapless linen was
wont to be beaten and banged as though it
were so many sheets of cast-iron. And here
with her gossips and friends, Candida could not
help letting fall little words and stray sentences
which revealed the trouble her mind was in as
to the change in her master. She was devoted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
to him, but her devotion was not so strong as
her love of mystery and her impatience of anything
which opposed a barrier to her curiosity.
She was not conscious that she said a syllable
which could have affected his reputation, yet her
neighbours all went away from her with the
idea that there was something wrong in the
presbytery, and that, if she had chosen, the
priest's housekeeper could have told some very
strange tales.</p>

<p>Since the days of the miller's murder, a
vague feeling against Don Gesualdo had been
growing up in Marca. A man who does not
cackle, and scream, and roar, till he is hoarse,
at the slightest thing which happens, is always
unnatural and suspicious in the eyes of an
Italian community. The people of Marca
began to remember that he had some fishermen's
blood in him, and that he had always
been more friendly with the wife of Tasso
Tassilo than had been meet in one of his
calling.</p>

<p>Falko Melegari had been denied admittance
to her by the authorities. They were not sure
that he, as her lover, had not some complicity
in the crime committed; and, moreover, his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
impetuous and inconsiderate language to the
Judge of Instruction at the preliminary investigation
had been so fierce and so unwise that it
had prejudiced against him all officers of the
law. This exclusion of him heightened the
misery he felt, and moved him also to a
querulous impatience with the vicar of San
Bartolo for being allowed to see her.</p>

<p>'Those black snakes slip and slide in anywhere,'
he thought, savagely; and his contempt
for and dislike of ecclesiastics, which the manner
and character of Don Gesualdo had held in
abeyance, revived in its pristine force.</p>

<p>In Easter-time, Don Gesualdo was always
greatly fatigued, and, when Easter came round
this year, and the sins of Marca were poured
into his ear&mdash;little, sordid, mean sins of which
the narration wearied and sickened him&mdash;they
seemed more loathsome to him than they had
ever done. There was such likeness and such
repetition in the confessions of all of them&mdash;greed,
avarice, dishonesty, fornication; the
scale never varied, and the story told kept
always at the same low level of petty and
coarse things. Their confessor heard, with a
tired mind, and a sick heart, and, as he gave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
them absolution, shuddered at the doubts of
the infallibility of his Church, which for the
first time passed with dread terror through his
thoughts. The whole world seemed to him
changing. He felt as though the solid earth
itself were giving way beneath his feet. His
large eyes had a startled and frightened look in
them, and his face grew thinner every day.</p>

<p>It was after the last office in this Easter week,
when a man came through the evening shadows
towards the church. His name was Emilio
Raffagiolo, but he was always known as the
<i>girellone</i>, the rover. Such nicknames replace
the baptismal names of the country people till
the latter are almost forgotten, whilst the family
name is scarcely ever employed at all in rural
communities. The <i>girellone</i> was a carter, who
had been in service at the water-mill for some
few months. He was a man of thirty or
thereabouts, with a dusky face and a shock
head of hair, and hazel eyes, dull and yet
cunning. He was dressed now in his festal
attire, and he had a round hat set on one side
of his head; he doffed it as he entered the
church. He could not read or write, and his
ideas of his creed were hazy and curious. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
Church represented to him a thing with virtue
in it, like a charm or a bunch of herbs; it was
only necessary, he thought, to observe certain
formulæ of it to be safe within it; conduct
outside it was of no consequence. Nothing on
earth can equal in confusion and indistinctness
the views of the Italian rustic as regards his
religion. The priest is to him as the medicine
man to the savage; but he has ceased to respect
his councils whilst retaining a superstitious feeling
about his office.</p>

<p>This man, doffing his hat, entered the church
and approached the confessional, crossing himself
as he did so. Don Gesualdo, with a sigh,
prepared to receive his confession, although the
hour was unusual, and the many services of the
day had fatigued him, until his head swam and
his vision was clouded. But at no time had he
ever availed himself of any excuse of time or
physical weakness to avoid the duties of his
office. Recognising the carter, he wearily
awaited the usual tale of low vice and petty sins,
some drunkenness, or theft, or lust, gratified in
some unholy way, and resigned himself wearily
to follow the confused repetitions with which
the rustic of every country answers questions or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
narrates circumstances. His conscience smote
him for his apathy. Ought not the soul of
this clumsy and wine-soddened boor to be as
dear to him as that of lovelier creatures?</p>

<p>The man answered the usual priestly interrogations
sullenly and at random; he could
not help doing what he did, because superstition
drove him to it, and was stronger for
the time than any other thing; but he was
angered at his own conscience, and afraid; his
limbs trembled, and his tongue seemed to him
to swell and grow larger than his mouth, and
refused to move as he said at length in a thick,
choked voice:</p>

<p>'It was I who killed him!'</p>

<p>'Who?' asked Don Gesualdo, whilst his
own heart stood still. Without hearing the
answer he knew what it would be.</p>

<p>'Tasso, the miller; my master,' said the
carter; and, having confessed thus far, he
recovered confidence and courage, and, in the
rude, involved, garrulous utterances common
to his kind, he leaned his mouth closer to
Gesualdo's ear, and told, with a curious sort
of pride in the accomplishment of it, why and
how it had been done.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
'I wanted to go to South America,' he
muttered. 'I have a cousin there, and he says
one makes money fast and works little. I had
often wished to take Tassilo's money, but I was
always afraid. He locked it up as soon as he
took any, were it ever so little, and it never
saw light again till it went to the bank, or
was paid away for her finery. He wasted many
a good fifty franc note on her back. Look
you, the night before the feast of Peter and
Paul, he had received seven hundred francs in
the day for wheat, and I saw him lock it up in
his bureau, and say to his wife that he should
take it to the town next day. That was in
the forenoon. At eventide they had a worse
quarrel than usual. She taunted him and he
threatened her. In the late night I lay
listening to hear him astir. He was up before
dawn, and he unbarred and opened the mill-house
himself, and called to the foreman, and
he said he was going to the town, and told us
what we were to do. 'I shall be away all
day,' he said. It was still dusky. I stole out
after him without the men seeing. I said to
myself I would take this money from him as
he went along the cross roads to take the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
diligence at Sant' Arturo. I did not say to
myself I would kill him, but I resolved to get
the money. It was enough to take one out
to America, and keep one awhile when one
got out there. So I made up my mind.
Money is at the bottom of most things. I
followed him half a mile before I could get my
courage up. He did not see me because of
the canes. He was crossing that grass where
the trees are so thick, when I said to myself,
'Now or never!' Then I sprang on him and
stabbed him under the shoulder. He fell like
a stone. I searched him, but there was nothing
in his pockets except a revolver loaded. I
think he had only made a feint of going to
the town, thinking to come back and find the
lovers together. I buried the knife under a
poplar a few yards off where he fell. I could
have thrown it in the river, but they say things
which have killed people always float. You
will find it if you dig for it under the big
poplar tree that they call the Grand Duke's,
because they say Pietro Leopoldo sat under
it once on a time. There was a little blood
on the blade, but there was none anywhere
else, for he bled inwardly. They do, if you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
strike right. I was a butcher's lad once, and
I used to kill the oxen, and I know. That is
all. When I found the old rogue had no
money with him, I could have killed him a
score of times over. I cannot think how it
was that he left home without it, unless it was,
as I say, that he meant to go back unknown
and unawares, and surprise his wife with
Melegari. That must have been it, I think.
For, greedy as he was over his money, he was
greedier still over his wife. I turned him over
on his back, and left him lying there, and I
went home to the mill and began my day's
work, till the people came and wakened her
and told the tale; then I left off work and
came and looked on like the rest of them.
That is all.'</p>

<p>The man who made the confession was calm
and unmoved; the priest who heard it was sick
with horror, pale to the lips with agitation and
anguish.</p>

<p>'But his wife is accused! She may be
condemned!' he cried, in agony.</p>

<p>'I know that,' said the man, stolidly. 'But
you cannot tell of me. I have told you under
the seal of confession.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
It was quite true; come what would, Don
Gesualdo could never reveal what he had heard.
His eyes swam, his head reeled, a deadly sickness
came upon him; all his short life simple
and harmless things had been around him; he
had been told of the crimes of men, but he had
never been touched by them; he had known
of the sins of the world, but he had never
realised them. The sense that the murderer
of Tasso Tassilo was within a hand's breadth
of him, that these eyes which stared at him,
this voice which spoke to him, were those of
the actual assassin, that it was possible, and
yet utterly impossible, for him to help justice
and save innocence&mdash;all this overcame him with
its overwhelming burden of horror and of
divided duty. He lost all consciousness as he
knelt there and fell heavily forward on the
wood-work of the confessional.</p>

<p>His teachers had said aright in the days
of his novitiate, that he would never be of
stern enough stuff to deal with the realities
of life.</p>

<p>When he recovered his senses, sight and
sound and sensibility all returning to him
slowly and with a strange, numb pricking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
pain in his limbs, and his body and his brain,
the church was quite dark, and the man who
had confessed his crime to him was gone.</p>

<p>Gesualdo gathered himself up with effort,
and sat down on the wooden seat and tried
to think. He was bitterly ashamed of his
own weakness. What was he worth, he,
shepherd and leader of men, if at the first
word of horror which affrighted him, he
fainted as women faint, and failed to speak
in answer the condemnation which should
have been spoken? Was it for such cowardice
as this that they had anointed him and received
him as a servitor of the Church?</p>

<p>His first impulse was to go and relate his
feebleness and failure to his bishop; the next
he remembered that even so much support
as this he must not seek; to no living being
must he tell this wretched blood-secret.</p>

<p>The law which respects nothing would not
respect the secrets of the confessional; but
he knew that all the human law in the world
could not alter his own bondage to the duty
he had with his own will accepted.</p>

<p>It was past midnight when, with trembling
limbs, he groped his way out of the porch of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
his church and found the entrance of the
presbytery, and climbed the stone stairs to
his own chamber.</p>

<p>Candida opened her door, and thrust her
head through the aperture, and cried to him:</p>

<p>'Where have you been mooning, reverend
sir, all this while, and the lamp burning to
waste and your good bed yawning for you?
You are not a strong man enough to keep
these hours, and for a priest they are not
decent ones.'</p>

<p>'Peace, woman,' said Don Gesualdo in a
tone which she had never heard from him.
He went within and closed the door. He
longed for the light of dawn, and yet he
dreaded it.</p>

<p>When the dawn came, it brought nothing
to him except the knowledge that the real
murderer was there, within a quarter of a
mile of him, and yet could not be denounced
by him to justice even to save the guiltless.</p>

<p>The usual occupations of a week-day claimed
his time, and he went through them all with
mechanical precision, but he spoke all his
words as in a dream, and the red sanded
bricks of his house, the deal table, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
the black coffee and the round loaf set out
on it, the stone sink at which Candida was
washing endive and cutting lettuces, the old
men and women who came and went telling
their troubles garrulously and begging for
pence, the sunshine which streamed in over
the threshold, the poultry which picked up
the crumbs off the floor, all these homely
and familiar things seemed unreal to him,
and were seen as through a mist.</p>

<p>This little narrow dwelling, with the black
cypress shadows falling athwart it, which had
once seemed to him the abode of perfect peace,
now seemed to imprison him, till his heart
failed and died within him.</p>

<p>In the dead of night, at the end of the week,
moved by an unconquerable impulse which had
haunted him the whole seven days, he rose and
lit a lanthorn and let himself out of his own
door noiselessly, stealthily, as though he were
on some guilty errand, and took the sexton's
spade from the tool-house and went across the
black shadows which stretched over the grass,
towards the place where the body of Tasso
Tassilo had lain dead. In the moonlight there
stood, tall and straight, a column of green leaves,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
it was the stately Lombardy poplar, which was
spared by the hatchet because Marca was, so
far as it understood anything, loyal in its regret
for the days that were gone. Many birds which
had been for hours sound asleep in its boughs
flew out with a great whirr of wings, and with
chirps of terror, as the footfall of the vicar
awakened and alarmed them. He set his
lanthorn down on the ground, for the rays of
the moon did not penetrate as far as the deep
gloom the poplars threw around them, and
began to dig. He dug some little time without
success, then his spade struck against something
which shone amidst the dry clay soil: it
was the knife. He took it up with a shudder.
There were dark red spots on the steel blade.
It was a narrow, slightly curved, knife, about
six inches long, such a knife as every Italian of
the lower classes carries every day, in despite
of the law, and with which most Italian murders
are committed.</p>

<p>He looked at it long. If the inanimate thing
could but have spoken, could but have told the
act which it had done!</p>

<p>He, kneeling on the ground, gazed at it with
a sickening fascination, then he replaced it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
deeper down in the ground, and with his spade
smoothed the earth with which he covered it.
The soil was so dry that it did not show much
trace of having been disturbed. Then he returned
homeward, convinced now of the truth
of the confession made to him. Some men
met him on the road, country lads driving
cattle early to a distant fair; they saluted him
with respect, but laughed when they had passed
him.</p>

<p>What had his reverence, they wondered,
been doing with a spade this time of night?
Did he dig for treasure? There was a tradition
in the country side, of sacks of ducal gold
which had been buried by the river to save
them from the French troops in the time of
the invasion by the First Consul.</p>

<p>Don Gesualdo, unconscious of their comments,
went home, put the spade back in the
tool-house, unlocked his church, entered and
prayed long; then waking his sleepy sexton,
bade him rise, and set the bell ringing for the
first mass. The man got up grumbling because
it was still quite dark, and next day talked to
his neighbours about the queer ways of his
vicar; how he would walk all night about his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
room, sometimes get up and go out in the
dead of night even; he complained that his
own health and patience would soon give way.
An uneasy feeling grew up in the village, some
gossips even suggested that the bishop should
be spoken to in the town; but everyone was
fearful of being the first to take such a step,
and no one was sure how so great a person
could be approached, and the matter remained
in abeyance. But the disquietude, and the
antagonism, which the manner and appearance
of their priest had created, grew with the
growth of the year, and with it also the
impression that he knew more of the
miller's assassination than he would ever
say.</p>

<p>A horrible sense of being this man's accomplice
grew also upon himself; the bond of
silence which he kept perforce with this wretch
seemed to him to make him so. His slender
strength and sensitive nerves ill fitted him to
sustain so heavy a burden, so horrible a
knowledge.</p>

<p>'It has come to chastise me because I have
thought of her too often, have been moved by
her too warmly,' he told himself; and his soul<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
shrank within him at what appeared the greatness
of his own guilt.</p>

<p>Since receiving the confession of the carter,
he did not dare to seek an interview with
Generosa. He did not dare to look on her
agonised eyes and feel that he knew what could
set her free and yet must never tell it. He
trembled, lest in sight of the suffering of this
woman, who possessed such power to move
and weaken him, he should be untrue to his
holy office, should let the secret he had to keep
escape him. Like all timid and vacillating
tempers, he sought refuge in procrastination.</p>

<p>All unconscious of the growth of public
feeling against him, and wrapped in that absorption
which comes from one dominant idea,
he pursued the routine of his parochial life, and
went through all the ceremonials of his office,
hardly more conscious of what he did than the
candles which his sacristan lighted. The confession
made to him haunted him night and
day. He saw it, as it were, written in letters
of blood on the blank, white walls of his bed-chamber,
of his sacristy, of his church itself.
The murderer was there, at large, unknown to
all; at work like any other man in the clear,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
sweet sunshine, talking and laughing, eating
and drinking, walking and sleeping, yet as
unsuspected as a child unborn. And all the
while Generosa was in prison. There was
only one chance left, that she should be acquitted
by her judges. But even then the slur
and stain of an imputed, though unproven,
crime would always rest upon her and make
her future dark, her name a by-word in her
birth-place. No mere acquittal, leaving doubt
and suspicion behind it, would give her back
to the light and joy of life. Every man's
hand would be against her; every child would
point at her as the woman who had been accused
of the assassination of her husband.</p>

<p>One day he sought Falko Melegari, when
the latter was making up the accounts of his
stewardship at an old bureau in a deep window-embrasure
of the villa.</p>

<p>'You know that the date of the trial is fixed
for the tenth of next month?' he said, in a
low, stifled voice.</p>

<p>The young man, leaning back in his wooden
chair, gave a sign of assent.</p>

<p>'And you?' said Don Gesualdo, with a
curious expression in his eyes, 'if they absolve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
her, will you have the courage to prove your
own belief in her innocence? Will you marry
her when she is set free?'</p>

<p>The question was abrupt and unlooked for;
Falko changed colour; he hesitated.</p>

<p>'You will not!' said Don Gesualdo.</p>

<p>'I have not said so,' answered the young
man, evasively. 'I do not know that she
would exact it.'</p>

<p>Exact it! Don Gesualdo did not know much
of human nature, but he knew what the use of
that cold word implied.</p>

<p>'I thought you loved her! I mistook,' he
said, bitterly. A rosy flush came for a moment
on the wax-like pallor of his face.</p>

<p>Falko Melegari looked at him insolently.</p>

<p>'A churchman should not meddle with these
things! Love her! I love her&mdash;yes. It
ruins my life to think of her yonder. I would
cut off my right arm to save her; but to marry
her if she come out absolved&mdash;that is another
thing; one's name a by-word, one's credulity
laughed at, one's neighbours shy of one&mdash;that
is another thing, I say. It will not be enough
for her judges to acquit her; that will not
prove her innocence to all the people here,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
or to my people at home in my own
country.'</p>

<p>He rose and pushed his heavy chair away
impatiently; he was ashamed of his own words,
but in the most impetuous Italian natures, prudence
and self-love are oftentimes the strongest
instincts. The priest looked at him with a
great scorn in the depths of his dark, deep,
luminous eyes. This handsome and virile
lover seemed to him a very poor creature; a
coward and faithless.</p>

<p>'In the depths of your soul you doubt her
yourself!' he said, with severity and contempt,
as he turned away from the writing table, and
went out through the windows into the garden
beyond.</p>

<p>'No, as God lives, I do not doubt her,' cried
Falko Melegari. 'Not for an hour, not for a
moment. But to make others believe&mdash;that is
more difficult. I will maintain her and befriend
her always if they set her free; but marry her&mdash;take
her to my people&mdash;have everyone say
that my wife had been in gaol on suspicion of
murder&mdash;that I could not do; no man would
do it who had a reputation to lose. One loves
for love's sake, but one marries for the world's.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
He spoke to empty air; there was no one to
hear him but the little green lizards who had
slid out of their holes in the stone under the
window-step. Don Gesualdo had gone across
the rough grass of the garden, and had passed
out of sight beyond the tall hedge of rose-laurel.</p>

<p>The young man resumed his writing, but he
was restless and uneasy, and could not continue
his calculations of debit and credit, of loss and
profit. He took his gun, whistled his dog, and
went up towards the hills, where hares were to
be found in the heather and snipe under the
gorse, for close time was unrecognised in the
province. His temper was ruffled, and his
mind in great irritation against his late companion;
he felt angrily that he must have
appeared a poltroon, and a poor and unmanly
lover in the eyes of the churchman. Yet he
had only spoken, he felt sure, as any other man
would have done in his place.</p>

<p>In the sympathy of their common affliction,
his heart had warmed for awhile to Gesualdo,
as to the only one who, like himself, cared for
the fate of Tasso Tassilo's wife; but now that
suspicion had entered into him, there returned
with it all his detestation of the Church<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
and all the secular hatreds which the gentle
character of the priest of Marca had for a time
lulled in him.</p>

<p>'Of course he is a liar and a hypocrite,' he
thought, savagely. 'Perhaps he was a murderer
as well!'</p>

<p>He knew that the idea was a kind of madness.
Don Gesualdo had never been known to hurt a
fly; indeed, his aversion to even see pain inflicted
had made him often the laughing-stock
of the children of Marca when he had rescued
birds, or locusts, or frogs, from their tormenting
fingers, and forbade them to throw stones
at the lambs or kids they drove to pasture.
'They are not baptised,' the children had often
said, with a grin, and Gesualdo had often
answered: 'The good God baptised them Himself.'</p>

<p>It was utter madness to suppose that such a
man, tender as a woman, timid as a sheep, gentle
as a spaniel, could possibly have stabbed Tasso
Tassilo to the death within a few roods of his
own church, almost on holy ground itself. And
yet, the idea grew and grew in the mind of Generosa's
lover until it acquired all the force of an
actual conviction. We welcome no supposition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
so eagerly as we do one which accords with and
intensifies our own prejudices. He neglected
his duties and occupations to brood over this
one suspicion, and put together all the trifles
which he could remember in confirmation of it.
It haunted him wherever he was; at wine fair,
at horse market, at cattle sale, in the corn-field,
amongst the vines, surrounded by his peasantry
at noonday, or alone in the wild, deserted
garden of the villa by moonlight.</p>

<p>In his pain and fury, it was a solace to
him to turn his hatred on to some living
creature. As he sat alone and thought over
all which had passed (as he did think of it
night and day always), many a trifle rose
to his mind which seemed to him to confirm
his wild and vague suspicions of the vicar of
San Bartolo. Himself a free-thinker, it appeared
natural to suspect any kind of crime
in a member of the priesthood. The sceptic
is sometimes as narrow and as arrogant in
his free-thought as the believer in his bigotry.
Falko Melegari was a good-hearted young man,
and kind, and gay, and generous by nature; but
he had the prejudices of his time and of his
school. These prejudices made him ready to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
believe that a priest was always fit food for the
galleys, or the scaffold, a mass of concealed
iniquity covered by his cloth.</p>

<p>'I believe you know more than anyone,'
he said, roughly, one day when he passed the
vicar on a narrow field-path, while his eyes
flashed suspiciously over the downcast face
of Don Gesualdo, who shrank a little as if he
had received a blow, and was silent.</p>

<p>He had spoken on an unconsidered impulse,
and would have been unable to say
what his own meaning really was; but as he
saw the embarrassment, and observed the
silence, of his companion, what he had
uttered at hazard seemed to him curiously
confirmed and strengthened.</p>

<p>'If you know anything which could save
her, and you do not speak,' he said, passionately,
'may all the devils you believe in
torture you through all eternity!'</p>

<p>Don Gesualdo still kept silent. He made
the sign of the cross nervously, and went
on his way.</p>

<p>'Curse all these priests,' said the young
man, bitterly, looking after him. 'If one
could only deal with them as one does with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
other men!&mdash;but, in their vileness and their
feebleness, they are covered by their frock
like women.'</p>

<p>He was beside himself with rage and
misery, and the chafing sense of his own
impotence; he was young, and strong, and
ardently enamoured, and yet he could do
no more to save the woman he loved from
eternal separation from him than if he had
been an idiot or an infant, than if he had
had no heart in his breast, and no blood
in his veins.</p>

<p>Whenever he met the vicar afterwards,
he did not even touch his hat, but scowled
at him in scorn, and ceased those outward
observances of respect to the Church which
he had always given before to please his
master, who liked such example to be set
by the steward to the peasantry.</p>

<p>'If Ser Baldo send me away for it, so
he must do,' he thought. 'I will never
set foot in the church again. I should
choke that accursed <i>parocco</i> with his own
wafer.'</p>

<p>For suspicion is a poisonous weed which,
if left to grow unchecked, soon reaches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
maturity, and Falko Melegari soon persuaded
himself that his own suspicion was a truth,
which only lacked time, and testimony, to
become as clear to all eyes as it was to
his.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span></p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>Meantime Don Gesualdo was striving with the
utmost force that was in him to persuade the
real criminal to confess publicly what he had
told under the seal of confession. He saw the
man secretly, and used every argument with
which the doctrines of his Church and his
own intense desires could supply him. But
there is no obstinacy so dogged, no egotism so
impenetrable, no shield against persuasion so
absolute, as the stolid ignorance and self-love
of a low mind. The carter turned a deaf ear
to all censure as to all entreaty; he was stolidly
indifferent to all the woe that he had caused
and would cause if he remained silent. What
was all that to him? The thought of the
miller's widow shut up in prison pleased him.
He had always hated her as he had seen her in
what he called her finery, going by him in the
sunshine, with all her bravery of pearl necklace,
of silver hairpins, of gold breast chains. Many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
and many a time he had thirsted to snatch at
them and pull them off her. What right had
she to them, she, a daughter of naked, hungry
folks, who dug and carted sea and river sand
for a living even as he carted sacks of flour.
She was no better than himself! Now and
then, Generosa had called him, in her careless,
imperious fashion, to draw water or carry wood
for her, and when he had done so she never
had taken the trouble to bid him good day or
to say a good-natured word. His pride had
been hurt, and he had had much ado to restrain
himself from calling her a daughter of beggars,
a worm of the sand. Like her own people, he
was pleased that she should now find her fine
clothes and her jewelled trinkets of no avail to
her, and that she should weep the light out of
her big eyes, and the rose-bloom off her peach-like
cheeks in the squalor and nausea of a town
prison.</p>

<p>Don Gesualdo, with all the force which a
profound conviction that he speaks the truth
lends to any speaker, wrestled for the soul of
this dogged brute, and warned him of the
punishment everlasting which would await him
if he persisted in his refusal to surrender himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
to justice. But he might as well have
spoken to the great millstones that rest in the
river water. Why, then, had this wretch cast
the burden of his vile secret on innocent
shoulders? It was the most poignant anguish
to him that he could awaken no sense of guilt
in the conscience of the criminal. The man
had come to him partly from a vague superstitious
impulse, remnant of a credulity instilled
into him in childhood, and partly from the
want to unburden his mind, to tell his story to
someone, which is characteristic of all weak
minds in times of trouble and peril. It had
relieved him to drag the priest into sharing his
own guilty consciousness; he was half proud
and half afraid of the manner in which he had
slain his master, and bitterly incensed that he
had done the deed for nothing; but, beyond
this, he had no other emotion except that he
was glad that Generosa should suffer through
and for it.</p>

<p>'You will burn for ever if you persist in
such hideous wickedness,' said Don Gesualdo
again and again to him.</p>

<p>'I will take my chance of that,' said the man.
'Hell is far off, and the galleys are near.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
'But if you do not believe in my power to
absolve you or leave you accursed, why did you
ever confess to me?' cried Don Gesualdo.</p>

<p>'Because one must clear one's breast to
somebody when one has a thing like that on
one's mind,' answered the carter, 'and I know
you cannot tell of it again.'</p>

<p>From that position nothing moved him.
No entreaties, threats, arguments, denunciations,
stirred him a hair's-breadth. He had confessed
<i>per sfogarsi</i> (to relieve himself): that was all.</p>

<p>But one night after Gesualdo had thus
spoken to him, vague fears assailed him, terrors
material, not spiritual; he had parted with his
secret; who could tell that it might not come
out like a sleuth hound, and find him and
denounce him? He had told it to be at peace,
but he was not at peace. He feared every
instant to have the hand of the law upon him.
Whenever he heard the trot of the carabineers'
horses going through the village, or saw their
white belts and cocked hats in the sunlight of
the fields, a cold tremor of terror seized him
lest the priest should after all have told. He
knew that it was impossible, and yet he was
afraid.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
He counted up the money he had saved, a
little roll of filthy and crumpled bank notes for
very small amounts, and wondered if they
would be enough to take him across to America.
They were very few, but his fear compelled him
to trust to them. He invented a story of
remittances which he had received from his
brother, and told his fellow-labourers and his
employer that he was invited to join that
brother, and then he packed up his few clothes
and went. At the mill and in the village they
talked a little of it, saying that the fellow was
in luck, but that they for their parts would not
care to go so far. Don Gesualdo heard of his
flight in the course of the day.</p>

<p>'Gone away! Out of the country?' he
cried involuntarily, with white lips.</p>

<p>The people who heard him wondered what
it could matter to him that a carter had gone to
seek his fortunes over the seas.</p>

<p>The carter had not been either such a good
worker, or such a good boon companion, that
anyone at the mill or in the village should
greatly regret him.</p>

<p>'America gets all our rubbish,' said the
people, 'much good may it do her.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
Meantime, the man took his way across the
country, and, sometimes by walking, sometimes
by lifts in waggons, sometimes by helping charcoal
burners on the road, made his way, first to
Vendramino to have his papers put in order,
and then to the sea coast, and in the port of
Leghorn took his passage in an emigrant ship
then loading there. The green cane-brakes and
peaceful millet fields of Marca saw him no
more.</p>

<p>But he had left the burden of his blood-guiltiness
behind him, and it lay on the guiltless
soul with the weight of the world.</p>

<p>So long as the man had remained in Marca,
there had been always a hope present with Don
Gesualdo that he would persuade him to confess
in a court of justice what he had confessed to
the church, or that some sequence of accidents
would lead up to the discovery of his guilt.
But with the ruffian gone across the seas, lost in
that utter darkness which swallows up the lives
of the poor and obscure when once they have
left the hamlet in which their names mean
something to their neighbours, this one hope
was quenched, and the vicar, in agony, reproached
himself with not having prevailed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
his struggle for the wretch's soul; with not
having been eloquent enough, or wise enough,
or stern enough to awe him into declaration of
his ghastly secret to the law.</p>

<p>His failure seemed to him a sign of Heaven's
wrath against himself.</p>

<p>'How dare I,' he thought, 'how dare I,
feeble and timid and useless as I am, call myself
a servant of God, or attempt to minister to
other souls?'</p>

<p>He had thought, like an imbecile, as he told
himself, to be able to awaken the conscience and
compel the public confession of this man, and
the possibility of flight had never presented
itself to his mind, natural and simple as had
been such a course to a creature without remorse,
continually haunted by personal fears of
punishment. He, he alone on earth, knew the
man's guilt; he, he alone had the power to
save Generosa, and he could not use the power
because the secrecy of his holy office was
fastened on him like an iron padlock on his
lips.</p>

<p>The days passed him like nightmares; he
did his duties mechanically, scarcely consciously;
the frightful alternative which was set before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
him seemed to parch up the very springs of life
itself. He knew that he must look strangely
in the eyes of the people; his voice sounded
strangely in his own ears; he began to feel that
he was unworthy to administer the blessed
bread to the living, to give the last unction to
the dying; he knew that he was not at fault,
and yet he felt that he was accursed. Choose
what he would, he must, he thought, commit
some hateful sin.</p>

<p>The day appointed for the trial came; it was
the tenth of May. A hot day, with the bees
booming amongst the acacia flowers, and the
green tree-frogs shouting joyously above in the
ilex tops, and the lizards running in and out of
the china-rose hedges on the highways. Many
people of Marca were summoned as witnesses,
and these went to the town in mule carts or
crazy chaises, with the farm-horse put in the
shafts, and grumbled because they would lose
their day's labour in their fields, and yet were
pleasurably excited at the idea of seeing Generosa
in the prisoner's dock, and being able
themselves to tell all they knew, and a great
deal that they did not know.</p>

<p>Falko Melegari rode over at dawn by himself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
and Don Gesualdo, with his housekeeper
and sacristan, who were all summoned to give
testimony, went by the diligence, which started
from Sant' Arturo, and rolled through the
dusty roads and over the bridges, and past the
wayside shrines, and shops, and forges, across
the country to the town.</p>

<p>The vicar never spoke throughout the four
weary hours during which the rickety and
crowded vehicle, with its poor, starved, bruised
beasts, rumbled on its road through the lovely
shadows and cool sunlight of the early morning.
He held his breviary in his hand for form's
sake, and, seeing him thus absorbed in holy
meditation as they thought, his garrulous
neighbours did not disturb him, but chattered
amongst themselves, filling the honeysuckle-scented
air with the odours of garlic and wine
and coarse tobacco.</p>

<p>Candida glanced at him anxiously from time
to time, haunted by a vague presentiment of
ill. His face looked very strange, she thought,
and his closely-locked lips were white as the
lips of a corpse. When the diligence was
driven over the stones of the town, all the
passengers by it descended at the first wine-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>house
which they saw on the piazza to eat
and drink, but he, with never a word, motioned
his housekeeper aside when she would have
pressed food on him, and went into the
cathedral of the place to pray alone.</p>

<p>The town was hot and dusty and sparsely
peopled. It had brown walls and large brick
palaces untenanted, and ancient towers, also of
brick, pointing high to heaven. It was a place
dear to the memory of lovers of art for the
sake of some fine paintings of the Sienese school
which hung in its churches, and was occasionally
visited by strangers for sake of these; but, for
the most part, it was utterly forgotten by the
world, and its bridge of many arches, said to
have been built by Augustus, seldom resounded
to any other echoes than those of the
heavy wheels of the hay or corn waggons
coming in from the pastoral country around.</p>

<p>The Court-house, where all great trials took
place, stood in one of the bare, silent, dusty squares
of the town. It had once been the ancient palace
of the Podesta, and had the machicolated walls,
the turreted towers, and the vast stairways and
frescoed chambers of a larger and statelier time
than ours. The hall of justice was a vast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
chamber pillared with marble, vaulted and
painted, sombre and grand. It was closely
thronged with country folks; there was a scent
of hay, of garlic, of smoking pipes hastily
thrust into trouser pockets, of unwashed flesh
steaming hotly in the crowd, and the close
air. The judge was there with his officers, a
mediæval figure in black square cap and black
gown. The accused was behind the cage assigned
to such prisoners, guarded by carabineers
and by the jailers. Don Gesualdo looked in
once from a distant doorway; then with a
noise in his ears like the sound of the sea,
and a deadly sickness on him, he stayed without
in the audience-chamber, where a breath
of air came to him up one of the staircases,
there waiting until his name was called.</p>

<p>The trial began. Everything was the same
as it had been in the preliminary examination
which had preceded her committal on the
charge of murder. The same depositions were
made now that had then been made. In the
interval, the people of Marca had forgotten
a good deal, so added somewhat of their own
invention to make up for the deficiency; but,
on the whole, the testimony was the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
given with that large looseness of statement,
and absolute indifference to fact, so characteristic
of the Italian mind, the judge, from
habit, sifting the chaff from the wheat in the
evidence with unerring skill, and following
with admirable patience the tortuous windings
and the hazy imagination of the peasants he
examined.</p>

<p>The examination of the vicar did not come on
until the third day. These seventy or eighty
hours of suspense were terrible to him. He
scarcely broke his fast, or was conscious of
what he did. The whole of the time was
passed by him listening in the court of justice,
or praying in the churches. When at last he
was summoned, a cold sweat bathed his face
and hair; his hands trembled; he answered
the interrogations of the judge and of the
advocates almost at random; his replies seemed
scarcely to be those of a rational being; he
passionately affirmed her innocence with delirious
repetition and emphasis, which produced
on the minds of the examiners the contrary
effect to that which he endeavoured to create.</p>

<p>'This priest knows that she is guilty,'
thought the president. 'He knows it&mdash;perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
he knows even more&mdash;perhaps he was her
accomplice.'</p>

<p>His evidence, his aspect, his wild and contradictory
words, did as much harm to her
cause as he ignorantly strove to do good.
From other witnesses of Marca, the Court
had learned that a great friendship had always
been seen to exist between the vicar of San
Bartolo and Generosa Fè, and that on the
morning when the murder was discovered,
the priest had removed the body of the dead
man to the sacristy, forestalling the officers of
justice and disturbing the scene of the murder.
A strong impression against him was created
beforehand in the audience and on the bench,
and his pallid, agitated countenance, his incoherent
words, his wild eyes, which incessantly
sought the face of the prisoner, all
gave him the appearance of a man conscious
of some guilt himself and driven out of his
mind by fear. The president cross-examined
him without mercy, censured him, railed at
him, and did his uttermost to extract the truth
which he believed that Don Gesualdo concealed,
but to no avail; incoherent and half-insane as
he seemed, he said no syllable which could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
betray that which he really knew. Only when
his eyes rested on Generosa, there was such an
agony in them that she herself was startled
by it.</p>

<p>'Who would ever have dreamt that he
would have cared so much?' she thought.
'But he was always a tender soul; he always
pitied the birds in the traps, and the oxen that
went to the slaughter.'</p>

<p>Reproved, and censured without stint, for
the president knew that to insult a priest was
to merit promotion in high quarters, Don
Gesualdo was at last permitted to escape from
his place of torture. Blind and sick he got
away through the crowd, past the officials,
down the stairs, and out into the hot air.
The piazza was thronged with people who
could not find standing room in the Court-house.
The murmur of their rapid and loud
voices was like the noise of a sea on his ears;
they had all the same burden. They all repeated
like one man the same words: 'They
will condemn her,' and then wondered what
sentence she would receive; whether a score
of years of seclusion or a lifetime.</p>

<p>He went through the chattering, curious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
cruel throng, barbarous with that barbarity of
the populace, which in all countries sees with
glee a bull die, a wrestler drop, a malefactor
ascend the scaffold, or a rat scour the streets
soaked in petroleum and burning alive. The
dead man had been nothing to them, and his
wife had done none of them any harm, yet
there was not a man or a woman, a youth or
a girl in the crowd, who would not have felt
that he or she was defrauded of his entertainment
if she were acquitted by her judges,
although there was a general sense amongst
them that she had done no more than had
been natural, and no more than had been her
right.</p>

<p>The dark, slender, emaciated figure of the
priest glided through the excited and boisterous
groups; the air had the heat of summer; the
sky above was blue and cloudless; the brown
brick walls of church and palace seemed baking
in the light of the sun. In the corner of the
square was a fountain relic of the old times
when the town had been a place of pageantry
and power; beautiful pale green water, cold
and fresh, leaping and flowing around marble
dolphins. Don Gesualdo stooped and drank<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
thirstily, as though he would never cease to
drink, then went on his way and pushed aside
the leathern curtain of the cathedral door and
entered into the coolness and solitude of that
place of refuge.</p>

<p>There he stretched himself before the cross
in prayer, and wept bitter, burning, unavailing
tears for the burden which he bore of another's
sin and his own helplessness beneath it, which
seemed to him like a greater crime.</p>

<p>But even at the very altar of his God, peace
was denied him. Hurried, loud, impetuous
steps from heavy boots fell on the old, worn,
marble floor of the church, and Falko Melegari
strode up behind him and laid a heavy hand
upon his shoulders. The young man's face
was deeply flushed, his eyes were savage, his
breath was quick and uneven; he had no heed
for the sanctity of the place or of his companion.</p>

<p>'Get up and hear me,' he said, roughly.
'They all say the verdict will be against her;
you heard them.'</p>

<p>Don Gesualdo made a gesture of assent.</p>

<p>'Very well, then,' said the steward, through
his clenched teeth, 'if it be so, indeed, I swear,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
as you and I live, that I will denounce you to
the judges in her stead.'</p>

<p>Don Gesualdo did not speak. He stood in
a meditative attitude with his arms folded on
his chest. He did not express either surprise
or indignation.</p>

<p>'I will denounce you,' repeated Melegari,
made more furious by his silence. 'What
did you do at night with your spade under the
Grand Duke's poplars? Why did you carry
in and screen the corpse? Does not the whole
village talk of your strange ways and your
altered habits? There is more than enough
against you to send to the galleys a score of
better men than you. Anyhow, I will denounce
you if you do not make a clean breast
of all you know to the president to-morrow.
You are either the assassin or the accomplice,
you accursed, black-coated hypocrite!'</p>

<p>A slight flush rose on the waxen pallor of
Don Gesualdo's face, but he still kept silence.</p>

<p>The young man, watching him with eyes of
hatred, saw guilt in that obstinate and mulish
dumbness.</p>

<p>'You dare not deny it, trained liar though
you be!' he said, with passionate scorn. 'Oh,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
wretched cur, who ventures to call yourself a
servitor of heaven, you would let her drag all
her years out in misery to save your own
miserable, puling, sexless, worthless life! Well!
hear me and understand. No one can say that
I do not keep my word, and here, by the cross
which hangs above us, I take my oath that if
you do not tell all you know to-morrow, should
she be condemned, I will denounce you to the
law, and if the law fail to do justice, I will kill
you as Tasso Tassilo was killed. May I die
childless, penniless, and accursed if my hand
fail!'</p>

<p>Then, with no other word, he strode from
the church, the golden afternoon sunshine
streaming through the stained windows above
and falling on his fair hair, his flushed face, his
flaming eyes, till his common humanity seemed
all transfigured. He looked like the avenging
angel of Tintoretto's Paradise.</p>

<p>Don Gesualdo stood immovable in the
deserted church; his arms crossed on his
breast, his head bent. A great resolve, a
mighty inspiration, had descended on him with
the furious words of his foe. Light had come
to him as from heaven itself. He could not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
give up the secret which had been confided to
him in the confessional, but he could give up
himself. His brain was filled with legends of
sacrifice and martyrdom. Why might he not
become one of that holy band of martyrs?</p>

<p>Nay, he was too humble to place himself
beside them even in thought. The utmost he
could do, he knew, would be only expiation
for what seemed to him his ineffaceable sin in
letting any human affection, however harmless,
unselfish, and distant, stain the singleness and
purity of his devotion to his vows. He had
been but a fisher-boy, until he had taken his
tender heart and his ignorant mind to the
seminary, and he had been born with the soul
of a San Rocco, of a S. John, out of place, out
of time, in the world he lived in; a soul in
which the passions of faith and of sacrifice were
as strong as are the passions of lust and of
selfishness in other natures. The spiritual
world was to him a reality, and the earth, with
its merciless and greedy peoples, its plague of
lusts, its suffering hearts, its endless injustice,
an unreal and hideous dream.</p>

<p>To his temper, the sacrifice which suddenly
rose before him as his duty, appeared one which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
would reconcile him at once to the Deity he
had offended, and the humanity he was tempted
to betray. To his mind, enfeebled and exhausted
by long fasting of the body and denial
of every natural indulgence, such sacrifice of
self seemed an imperious command from
heaven. He would drag out his own life in
misery, and obloquy, indeed, but what of that?
Had not the great martyrs and founders of his
Church endured as much or more? Was it
not by such torture, voluntarily accepted and
endured on earth, that the grace of God was
won?</p>

<p>He would tell a lie, indeed; he would draw
down ignominy on the name of the Church;
he would make men believe that an anointed
priest was a common murderer, swayed by low
and jealous hatreds; but of this he did not
think. In the tension and perplexity of his
tortured soul, the vision of a sacrifice in which
he would be the only sufferer, in which the
woman would be saved, and the secret told
to him be preserved, appeared as a heaven-sent
solution of the doubts and difficulties in his
path. Stretched in agonised prayer before one
of the side altars of the cathedral, he imagined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
the afternoon sunbeams streaming through the
high window on his face to be the light of a
celestial world, and in the hush and heat of the
incense-scented air, he believed that he heard a
voice which cried to him, 'By suffering all
things are made pure.'</p>

<p>He was not a wise, or strong, or educated
man. He had the heart of a poet, and the
mind of a child. There was a courage in him
to which sacrifice was welcome, and there was a
credulity in him which made all exaggeration of
simple faith possible. He was young and
ignorant and weak; yet at the core of his
heart there was a dim heroism: he could
suffer and be mute, and in the depths of his
heart he loved this woman better than himself,
with a love which in his belief made him
accursed for all time.</p>

<p>When he at last arose and went out of the
church doors, his mind was made up to the
course that he would take; an immense calm
had descended upon the unrest of his soul.</p>

<p>The day was done, the sun had set, the
scarlet flame of its afterglow bathed all the
rusty walls and dusty ground with colours of
glory. The crowd had dispersed; there was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
no sound in the deserted square except the
ripple of the water as it fell from the dolphins'
mouths into the marble basin. As he heard
that sweet, familiar murmur of the falling
stream, the tears rose in his eyes and blotted
out the flame-like pomp and beauty of the
skies. Never again would he hear the water
of the Marca river rushing, in cool autumn
days, past the poplar stems and the primrose
roots upon its mossy banks; never again would
he hear in the place of his birth the grey-green
waves of Arno sweeping through the cane-brakes
to the sea.</p>

<p>At three of the clock on the following day
the judgment was given in the court.</p>

<p>Generosa Fè was decreed guilty of the
murder of her husband, and sentenced to
twenty years of solitary confinement. She
dropped like a stone when she heard the
sentence, and was carried out from the court
insensible. Her lover, when he heard it, gave
a roar of anguish like that of some great
beast in torment, and dashed his head against
the wall and struggled like a mad bull in the
hands of the men who tried to hold him. Don
Gesualdo, waiting without, on the head of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
staircase, did not even change countenance;
to him this bitterness, as of the bitterness of
death, had been long past; he had been long
certain what the verdict would be, and he
had, many hours before, resolved on his own
part.</p>

<p>A great calm had come upon his soul, and
his face had that tranquillity which comes alone
from a soul which is at peace within itself.</p>

<p>The sultry afternoon shed its yellow light on
the brown and grey and dusty town; the crowd
poured out of the Court-house, excited, contrite,
voluble, pushing and bawling at one another,
ready to take the side of the condemned
creature now that she was the victim of the
law. The priest alone of them all did not
move; he remained sitting on the upright
chair under a sculptured allegory of Justice
and Equity which was on the arch above his
head, and with the golden light of sunset falling
down on him through the high casement above.
He paid no heed to the hurrying of the crowd,
to the tramp of guards, to the haste of clerks
and officials eager to finish their day's work and
get away to their wine and dominoes at the
taverns. His hands mechanically held his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
breviary; his lips mechanically repeated a
Latin formula of prayer. When all the people
were gone, one of the custodians of the place
touched his arm, telling him that they
were about to close the doors; he raised his
eyes like one who is wakened from a trance,
and to the man said quietly:</p>

<p>'I would see the president of the court for a
moment, quite alone. Is it possible?'</p>

<p>After many demurs and much delay, they
brought him into the presence of the judge,
in a small chamber of the great palace.</p>

<p>'What do you want with me?' asked the
judge, looking nervously at the white face and
the wild eyes of his unbidden visitant.</p>

<p>Don Gesualdo answered: 'I am come to tell
you that you have condemned an innocent
woman.'</p>

<p>The judge looked at him with sardonic
derision and contempt.</p>

<p>'What more?' he asked. 'If she be innocent,
will you tell me who is guilty?'</p>

<p>'I am,' replied the priest.</p>

<p>At his trial he never spoke.</p>

<p>With his head bowed and his hands clasped,
he stood in the cage where she had stood, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
never replied by any single word to the repeated
interrogations of his judges. Many witnesses
were called, and all they said testified to the
apparent truth of his self-accusation. Those
who had always vaguely suspected him, all
those who had seen him close the door of the
sacristy on the crowd when he had borne the
murdered man within, the mule drivers who
had seen him digging at night under the great
poplars, the sacristan who had been awakened
by him that same night so early, even his old
housekeeper, though she swore that he was
a lamb, a saint, an angel, a creature too good
for earth, a holy man whose mind was distraught
by fasting, by visions, these all, either
wilfully or ignorantly, bore witness which confirmed
his own confession. The men of law
had the mould and grass dug up under the
Grand Duke's poplar, and when the blood-stained
knife was found therein, the very earth,
it seemed, yielded up testimony against him.</p>

<p>In the end, after many weeks of investigation,
Generosa was released and Don Gesualdo was
sentenced in her place.</p>

<p>Falko Melegari married her, and they went
to live in his own country in the Lombard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
plains, and were happy and prosperous, and
the village of Marca and the waters of its
cane-shadowed stream knew them no more.</p>

<p>Sometimes she would say to her husband:
'I cannot think that he was guilty; there
was some mystery in it.'</p>

<p>Her husband always laughed, and said in
answer: 'He was guilty, be sure; it was
I who frightened him into confession; those
black rats of the Church have livers as white
as their coats are black.'</p>

<p>Generosa did not wholly believe, but she
thrust the grain of doubt and of remorse
away from her and played with her handsome
children. After all, she mused, what
doubt could there be? Did not Don Gesualdo
himself reveal his guilt, and had he not always
cared for her, and was not the whole population
of Marca willing to bear witness that they
had always suspected him and had only held
their peace out of respect for the Church?</p>

<p>He himself lived two long years amongst
the galley-slaves of the western coast; all that
time he never spoke, and he was considered
by the authorities to be insane. Then, in
the damp and cold of the third winter, his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
lungs decayed, his frail strength gave way, he
died of what they called tuberculosis, in the
spring of the year. In his last moments
there was seen a light of unspeakable ecstasy
upon his face, a smile of unspeakable rapture
on his mouth.</p>

<p>'Domine Deus libera me!' he murmured,
as he died.</p>

<p>A bird came and sang at the narrow casement
of his prison cell as his spirit passed
away. It was a nightingale: perchance one
of those who had once sung to him in the
summer nights from the wild-rose hedge at
Marca.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_SILVER_CHRIST" id="THE_SILVER_CHRIST">THE SILVER CHRIST</a></h2>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>Genistrello is a wild place in the Pistoiese hills.</p>

<p>Its name is derived from the genista or broom
which covers many an acre of the soil, and shares
with the stone pine and the sweet chestnut the
scanty earth which covers its granite and sandstone.
It is beautiful exceedingly; but its
beauty is only seen by those to whom it is a
dead letter which they have no eyes to read.
It is one of the many spurs of the Apennines
which here lie overlapping one another in curve
upon curve of wooded slopes with the higher
mountains rising behind them; palaces, which
once were fortresses, hidden in their valleys, and
ruined castles, or deserted monasteries, crowning
their crests.</p>

<p>From some of these green hills the sea is
visible, and when the sun sets where the sea is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
and the red evening glows behind the distant
peaks, it is lovely as a poet's dream.</p>

<p>On the side of this lonely hill, known as
Genistrello, there dwelt a man of the name of
Castruccio Lascarisi. He was called 'Caris' by
the whole countryside; indeed, scarcely any
knew that he had another patronymic, so entirely
amongst these people does the nickname
extinguish, by its perpetual use, the longer
appellative.</p>

<p>His family name was of Greek extraction undoubtedly;
learned Greeks made it familiar in
the Italian Renaissance, at the courts of
Lorenzo and of Ludovico; but how it had
travelled to the Pistoiese hills to be borne by unlearned
hinds none knew, any more than any know
who first made the red tulip blossom as a wild
flower amidst the wheat, or who first sowed the
bulb of the narcissus amongst the wayside grass.</p>

<p>He lived miles away from the chapel and the
hamlet. He had a little cabin in the heart of
the chestnut woods, which his forefathers had
lived in before him; they had no title which
they could have shown for it except usage, but
that had been title enough for them, and was
enough for Caris.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
It had been always so. It would be always
so. His ideas went no further. The autumnal
migration was as natural and inevitable to him
as to the storks and herons and wild duck
which used to sail over his head, going southward
like himself as he walked through the
Tuscan to the Roman Maremma. But his dislike
to the Maremma winters was great, and
had never changed in him since he had trotted
by his father's side, a curly-pated baby in a
little goatskin shirt looking like a Correggio's
St. John.</p>

<p>What he longed for, and what he loved, were
the cool heights of Genistrello and the stone
hut with the little rivulet of water gushing at
its threshold. No one had ever disturbed his
people there. It was a square little place built
of big unmortared stones in old Etruscan
fashion; the smoke from the hearth went out
by a hole in the roof, and a shutter and door of
unplaned wood closed its only apertures.</p>

<p>The lichen and weeds and mosses had welded
the stones together, and climbed up over its
conical rush roof. No better home could be
needed in summer-time; and when the cold
weather came, he locked the door and went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
down with his pack on his back and a goatshair
belt round his loins to take the familiar way to
the Roman Maremma.</p>

<p>Caris was six-and-twenty years old; he
worked amongst the chestnut woods in summer
and went to the Maremma for field labour in
the winter, as so many of these husbandmen
do; walking the many leagues which separate
the provinces, and living hardly in both seasons.
The songs they sing are full of allusions to this
semi-nomadic life, and the annual migration has
been a custom ever since the world was young&mdash;when
the great Roman fleets anchored where
now are sand and marsh, and stately classic
villas lifted their marble to the sun where now
the only habitation seen is the charcoal-burner's
rush-roofed, moss-lined hut.</p>

<p>Caris was a well-built, lithe, slender son of the
soil, brown from sun and wind, with the straight
features and the broad low brows of the classic
type, and great brown eyes like those of the
oxen which he drove over the vast plains down
in the Maremma solitudes. He knew nothing
except his work.</p>

<p>He was not very wise, and he was wholly
unlearned, but he had a love of nature in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
breast, and he would sit at the door of his hut
at evening time, with his bowl of bean-soup
between his knees, and often forget to eat in his
absorbed delight as the roseate glow from the
vanished sunrays overspread all the slopes of
the Pistoiese Apennines and the snow-crowned
crests of the Carara mountains.</p>

<p>'What do you see there, goose?' said a charcoal-burner,
once passing him as he sat thus
upon his threshold with the dog at his feet.</p>

<p>Caris shrugged his shoulders stupidly and
half-ashamed. He could not read the great
book outspread upon the knees of the mountains,
yet he imperfectly felt the beauty of its
emblazoned pages.</p>

<p>The only furniture in the cabin was a table
made of a plank, two rude benches, and one
small cupboard; the bed was only dried leaves
and moss. There were a pipkin, two platters,
and a big iron pot which swung by a cord and
a hook over the stones where the fire, when
lighted, burned. They were enough; he
would not have known what to do with more if
he had had more. He was only there from
May to October; and in the fragrant summers
of Italian chestnut woods, privation is easily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
borne. The winter life was harder and more
hateful; yet it never occurred to him to do else
than to go to Maremma; his father and grandfather
had always gone thither, and as naturally
as the chestnuts ripen and fall, so do the men in
autumn join the long lines of shepherds and
drovers and women and children and flocks and
herds which wind their way down the mountain
slopes and across the level wastes of plain and
marsh to seek herbage and work for the winter-time.</p>

<p>It never entered the head of Caris, or of the
few who knew him or worked with him, to
wonder how he and his had come thither. They
were there as the chestnut-trees were, as the
broom was, as the goats and squirrels and wood-birds
were there. The peasant no more wonders
about his own existence than a stone does.
For generations a Lascaris had lived in that
old stone hut which might itself be a relic of
an Etruscan tomb or temple. No one was
concerned to know further.</p>

<p>The peasant does not look back; he only
sees the road to gain his daily meal of bread
or chestnuts. The past has no meaning to him,
and to the future he never looks. That is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
reason why those who want to cultivate or convince
him fail utterly. If a man cannot see the
horizon itself, it is of no use to point out to
him spires or trees or towers which stand out
against it.</p>

<p>The world has never understood that the
moment the labourer is made to see, he is made
unhappy, being ill at ease and morbidly envious
and ashamed, and wholly useless. Left alone,
he is content in his own ruminant manner,
as the buffalo is when left untormented amidst
the marshes, grazing at peace and slumbering
amidst the rushes and the canes.</p>

<p>Caris was thus content. He had health and
strength, though sometimes he had a fever-chill
from new-turned soil and sometimes a frost-chill
from going out on an empty stomach
before the sun had broken the deep shadows of
the night. But from these maladies all outdoor
labourers suffer, and he was young, and
they soon passed. He had been the only son
of his mother; and this fact had saved him
from conscription. As if she had lived long
enough when she had rendered him this service,
she died just as he had fulfilled his twenty-third
year; and without her the stone hut seemed for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
awhile lonely; he had to make his fire, and boil
or roast his chestnuts, and mend holes in his
shirts, and make his own rye loaves; but he
soon got used to this, and when in Maremma
he always worked with a gang, and was fed and
lodged&mdash;badly, indeed, but regularly&mdash;at the
huge stone burn which served such purposes on
the vast tenuta where the long lines of husbandmen
toiled from dusk of dawn to dusk of eve
under the eye and lash of their overseer; and
when on his native slopes of Genistrello he was
always welcome to join the charcoal-burners'
rough company or the woodsmen's scanty
supper, and seldom passed, or had need to pass,
his leisure hours alone. And these were very few.</p>

<p>His mother had been a violent-tempered
woman, ruling him with a rod of iron, as she
had ruled her husband before him; a woman
loud of tongue, stern of temper, dreaded for
miles around as a witch and an evil-eye; and
although the silence and solitude which reigned
in the cabin after her death oppressed him painfully
at first, he soon grew used to these, and
found the comfort of them. He brought a
dog with him after his winter in Maremma
which followed on his mother's loss&mdash;a white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
dog of the Maremma breed, and he and the
dog kept house together in the lonely woods in
fellowship and peace. Caris was gentle and
could never beat or kick a beast as others of
his kind do; and the oxen he drove knew this.
He felt more akin to them and to the dogs
than he did to the men with whom he worked.
He could not have expressed or explained this,
but he felt it.</p>

<p>He had little mind, and what he had moved
slowly when it moved at all; but he had a
generous nature, a loyal soul, and a simple and
manly enjoyment of his hard life. It did not
seem hard to him. He had run about on his
bare feet all his childhood until their soles were
as hard as leather, and he was so used to his
daily meal of chestnuts in cold weather, and of
maize or rye-bread with cabbage, or bean-soup,
in the hot season, that he never thought of
either as meagre fare. In summer he wore
rough hempen shirt and trousers; in winter
goatskin and rough homespun wool. In appearance,
in habits, in clothing, in occupation, he
differed little from the peasant who was on that
hillside in the times of Pliny and of Properticus.
Only the gods were changed; Pan piped no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
more in the thicket, the Naiad laughed no
longer in the brook, the Nymph and Satyr
frolicked never beneath the fronds of the ferns.</p>

<p>In their stead there was only a little gaudy
chapel on a stony slope, and a greasy, double-chinned,
yellow-cheeked man in black, who
frowned if you did not give him your hardly-earned
pence, and lick the uneven bricks of the
chapel floor when he ordered you a penance.</p>

<p>Caris cared little for that man's frown.</p>

<p>He sat thus at his door one evening when
the sun was setting behind the many peaks and
domes of the Apennine spurs which fronted
him. The sun itself had sunk beyond them
half an hour before, but the red glow which
comes and stays long after it was in the heavens
and on the hills.</p>

<p>Genistrello was a solitary place, and only
here and there a hut or cot like his own was
hidden away under the saplings and undergrowth.
Far away down in the valley were
the belfries and towers of the little strong-walled
city which had been so often as a lion in
the path to the invading hosts of Germany;
and like a narrow white cord the post-road,
now so rarely used, wound in and out until its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
slender thread was lost in the blue vapours of
the distance, and the shadows from the clouds.</p>

<p>Bells were tolling from all the little spires
and towers on the hills and in the valleys, for
it was a vigil, and there was the nearer tinkle
of the goats' bells under the heather and broom
as those innocent marauders cropped their supper
off the tender chestnut-shoots, the trails of
ground ivy, and the curling woodbine. Caris,
with his bowl of bean-soup between his knees
and his hunch of rye-bread in his hand, ate
hungrily, whilst his eyes filled themselves with
the beauty of the landscape. His stomach was
empty&mdash;which he knew, and his soul was empty&mdash;which
he did not know.</p>

<p>He looked up, and saw a young woman
standing in front of him. She was handsome,
with big, bright eyes, and a rosy mouth, and
dusky glossy hair coiled up on her head like a
Greek Venus.</p>

<p>He had never seen her before, and her sudden
apparition there startled him.</p>

<p>'Good-even, Caris,' she said familiarly, with
a smile like a burst of sunlight. 'Is the mother
indoors, eh?'</p>

<p>Caris continued to stare at her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
'Eh, are you deaf?' she asked impatiently.
'Is the mother in, I want to know?'</p>

<p>'My mother is dead,' said Caris, without
preamble.</p>

<p>'Dead! When did she die?'</p>

<p>'Half a year ago,' said Caris, with the peasant's
confusion of dates and elongation of time.</p>

<p>'That is impossible,' said the young woman
quickly. 'I saw her myself and spoke with her
here on this very spot in Easter week. What
makes you say she is dead?'</p>

<p>'Because she is dead!' said Caris doggedly.
'If you do not believe it, go and ask the
sacristan and sexton over there.'</p>

<p>He made a gesture of his head towards the
belfry of an old hoary church, dedicated to St.
Fulvo, which was seven miles away amongst the
chestnut woods of an opposing hillside, and
where his mother had been buried by her wish,
because it was her birthplace.</p>

<p>The girl this time believed him. She was
dumb for a little while with astonishment and
regret. Then she said, in a tone of awe and
expectation, 'She left her learning and power
with you, eh?&mdash;and the books?'</p>

<p>'No,' said Caris rudely. 'I had all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
uncanny things buried with her. What use
were they? She lived and died with scarce
a shift to her back.'</p>

<p>'Oh!' said the girl, in a shocked tone, as
though she reproved a blasphemy. 'She was a
wonderful woman, Caris.'</p>

<p>Caris laughed a little.</p>

<p>'Eh, you say so. Well, all her wisdom
never put bit nor drop in her mouth nor a
copper piece in her hand that I did not work
for; what use was it, pray?'</p>

<p>'Hush. Don't speak so!' said the maiden,
looking timidly over her shoulder to the undergrowth
and coppice growing dim in the shadows
of the evening.</p>

<p>'Tis the truth!' said Caris stubbornly. 'I
did my duty by her, poor soul; and yet I fear
me the Evil One waited for her all the while,
for as soon as the rattle came in her throat, a
white owl flapped and screeched on the thatch,
and a black cat had sat on the stones yonder
ever since the sun had set.'</p>

<p>'The saints preserve us!' murmured the
girl, her rich brown and red skin growing
pale.</p>

<p>There was silence; Caris finished munching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
his bread; he looked now and then at his visitor
with open-eyed surprise and mute expectation.</p>

<p>'You have buried the things with her?' she
asked him, in a low tone, at length.</p>

<p>He nodded in assent.</p>

<p>'What a pity! What a pity!'</p>

<p>'Why that?'</p>

<p>'Because if they are underground with her
nobody can use them.'</p>

<p>Caris stared with his eyes wider opened still.</p>

<p>'What do you want with the devil's tools, a
fresh, fair young thing like you?'</p>

<p>'Your mother used them for me,' she answered
crossly. 'And she had told me a
number of things&mdash;ay, a vast number! And
just in the middle uncle spied us out, and he
swore at her and dragged me away, and I had
never a chance to get back here till to-night,
and now&mdash;now you say she is dead, and she
will never tell me aught any more.'</p>

<p>'What can you want so sore to know?' said
Caris, with wonder, as he rose to his feet.</p>

<p>'That is my business,' said the girl.</p>

<p>'True, so it is,' said Caris.</p>

<p>But he looked at her with wonder in his dark-brown,
ox-like eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
'Where do you live?' he asked; 'and how
knew you my name?'</p>

<p>'Everybody knows your name,' she answered.
'You are Caris, the son of Lisabetta, and when
you sit on your doorstep it would be a fool
indeed would not see who you are.'</p>

<p>'So it would,' said Caris. 'But you,' he
added after a pause, 'who are you? And what
did you want with Black Magic?'</p>

<p>'I am Santina, the daughter of Neri, the
smith, by the west gate in Pistoia,' she said in
reply to the first question, and making none to
the second.</p>

<p>'But what wanted you of my mother?' he
persisted.</p>

<p>'They said she knew strange things,' said the
girl evasively.</p>

<p>'If she did she had little profit of them,' said
Caris sadly.</p>

<p>The girl looked at him with great persuasiveness
in her face, and leaned a little nearer to him.</p>

<p>'You did not really bury the charms with
her? You have got them inside? You will let
me see them, eh?'</p>

<p>'As the saints live, I buried them,' said
Caris truthfully; 'they were rubbish, or worse;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
accursed maybe. They are safe down in the
ground till the Last Day. What can such a
bright wench as yourself want with such queer,
unhallowed notions?'</p>

<p>The girl Santina glanced over her shoulders
to make sure that no one was listening; then
she said in a whisper:</p>

<p>'There is the Gobbo's treasure in these woods
somewhere&mdash;and Lisabetta had the wand that
finds gold and silver.'</p>

<p>Caris burst into a loud laugh.</p>

<p>'Ah, truly! That is a good jest. If she
could find gold and silver, why did we always
have iron spoons for our soup, and a gnawing
imp in our stomachs? Go to, my maiden. Do
not tell such tales. Lisabetta was a poor and
hungry woman all her days, and scarce left
enough linen to lay her out in decently, so help
me Heaven!'</p>

<p>The girl shook her head.</p>

<p>'You know there is the treasure in the
woods,' she said angrily.</p>

<p>'Nay, I never heard of it. Oh, the Gobbo's?
Che-che! For hundreds of years they have
grubbed for it all over the woods, and who
ever found anything, eh?'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
'Your mother was very nigh it often and
often. She told me.'</p>

<p>'In her dreams, poor soul!'</p>

<p>'But dreams mean a great deal.'</p>

<p>'Sometimes,' said Caris seriously. 'But
what is it to you?' he added, the suspicion
always inherent to the peasant struggling with
his admiration of the girl, who, unbidden, had
seated herself upon the stone before the door.
With feminine instinct she felt that to make
him do what she wished, she must confide in
him, or appear to confide.</p>

<p>And thereon she told him that unless she
could save herself, her family would wed her to
a wealthy old curmudgeon who was a cart-maker
in the town; and to escape this fate she
had interrogated the stars by means of the dead
Lisabetta and of the astrologer Faraone, who
dwelt also in the hills, but this latter reader of
destiny would tell her nothing, because he was
a friend of her father's, and now the witch of
Genistrello was dead and had left her fate but
half told!</p>

<p>'What did she tell you?' said Caris, wincing
at the word witch.</p>

<p>'Only that I should go over the mountains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
to some city and grow rich. But it was all dark&mdash;obscure&mdash;uncertain;
she said she would
know more next time; and how could I tell
that before I came again she would have died?'</p>

<p>'You could not tell that, no,' said Caris
absently.</p>

<p>He was thinking of the elderly well-to-do
wheelwright in the town, and he felt that he
would have liked to brain him with one of his
own wooden spokes or iron linchpins. For the
girl Santina was very beautiful as she sat there
with her large eyes shining in the shadows and
the tears of chagrin and disappointment stealing
down her cheeks. For her faith in her charms
and cards had been great, and in her bosom
there smouldered desires and ideas of which
she did not speak.</p>

<p>She saw the effect that her beauty produced,
and said to herself: 'He shall dig up the things
before he is a week older.'</p>

<p>She got up with apparent haste and alarm;
seeing how dark it had grown around her, only
a faint red light lingering far away above the
lines of the mountains.</p>

<p>'I am staying at the four roads with my aunt,
who married Massaio,' she said as she looked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
over her shoulder and walked away between the
chestnut sapling and the furze.</p>

<p>Caris did not offer to accompany or try to
follow her. He stood like one bewitched
watching her lithe, erect figure run down the
hill and vanish as the path wound out of sight
amongst the pines. No woman had ever
moved him thus. He felt as if she had poured
into him at once scalded wine and snow-water.</p>

<p>She was so handsome and bold and lissom,
and yet she made his flesh creep talking of his
mother's incantations, and bidding him knock
at the door of the grave.</p>

<p>'What an awful creature for tempting a man
is a woman,' he thought, 'and they will scream
at their own shadows one minute and dare the
devil himself the next!'</p>

<p>That night Caris sat smoking his black pipe
on the stone before the door where she had sat,
and the scalded wine and the snow-water coursed
by turns feverishly through his veins, as once
through Cymon's.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span></p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>'Where hast been, hussy?' said Massaio crossly,
yet jokingly, to his niece when she went home
that night.</p>

<p>The four roads was a place where the four
cart-tracks at the foot of that group of hills
met and parted; the man was a seller of wood,
and his cottage and his wood-yards and sheds
thatched with furze stood where the four roads
met under some huge stone pines. The aunt
of Santina had married there many years
before.</p>

<p>They were people well-off, who ate meat,
drank wine, and had a house full of hardware,
pottery, and old oak: people as far removed
from Caris and his like as if they had been lords
or princes. He knew them by sight, and doffed
his hat to them in the woods.</p>

<p>The thought that she was the niece of
Massaio, the man who paid for his wood and
charcoal with rolls of banknotes, and sent his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
own mules to bring the loads down from the
hills, placed Santina leagues away from and
above him.</p>

<p>The only women with whom he had ever had
any intercourse had been the rude wenches who
tramped with the herds, and dug and hoed
and cut grass and grain on the wastes of
the Maremma; creatures burnt black with the
sun and wrinkled by the winds, and with skin
hard and hairy, and feet whose soles were like
wood&mdash;'la femelle de l'homme,' but not so clean
of hide or sweet of breath as the heifers they
drove down along the sea-ways in autumn
weather.</p>

<p>This girl who called herself Santina was
wholesome as lavender, fresh as field thyme,
richly and fairly odoured as the flower of the
wild pomegranate.</p>

<p>When supper was over and the house was on
the point of being bolted and barred, Santina
threw her brown soft round arm round her
uncle's neck.</p>

<p>'I went down to see Don Fabio, and he was
out, and I sat talking with his woman and
forgot the time,' she said penitently.</p>

<p>Don Fabio was the priest of the little gaudy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
church low down in the valley where the post-road
ran.</p>

<p>Massaio patted the cheek, which was like an
apricot, and believed her.</p>

<p>Her aunt did not.</p>

<p>'There is still snow where the man of God
lives up yonder, and there is no water, only
dust, on her shoes,' thought the shrewd
observer.</p>

<p>But she did not say so; for she had no wish
to put her husband out of humour with her
kinsfolk.</p>

<p>But to Santina, when with her alone, she
said testily:</p>

<p>'I fear you are going again to the black arts
of that woman Lisabetta; no good ever is got
of them; it is playing with fire, and the devil
breathes the fire out of his mouth!'</p>

<p>'I cannot play with it if I wished,' said
Santina innocently; 'Lisabetta is dead months
ago.'</p>

<p>'That is no loss to anybody if it be true,'
said Eufemia Massaio angrily.</p>

<p>Lisabetta had been such an obscure and
lonely creature, that her death had been taken
little note of anywhere, and the busy, bustling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
housewife of Massaio had had no heed of such
an event. She had not even known the woman
by sight; had only been cognizant of her evil
repute for powers of sorcery.</p>

<p>Santina went up to her room, which she
shared with three of the Massaio children.
Long after they were sleeping in a tangle of
rough hair and brown limbs and healthy rosy
nudity, the girl, their elder, sat up on the rude
couch staring at the moon through the little
square window.</p>

<p>She was thinking of words that Lisabetta
had said, as she had dealt out the cards and
gazed in a bowl of spring water, 'Over the
hills and far away; wealth and pleasure and
love galore&mdash;where? how? when?&mdash;ay, that is
hid; but we shall see, we shall see; only over
the hills you go, and all the men are your
slaves.'</p>

<p>How? when? where? That was hidden
with the dead fortune-teller under the earth.</p>

<p>Santina did not for a moment doubt the
truth of the prophecy, but she was impatient
for its fulfilment to begin. She knew she was
of unusual beauty, and the organist at the
duomo in Pistoia had told her that her voice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
was of rare compass, and only wanted tuition
to be such a voice as fetches gold in the big
world which lay beyond these hills. But that
was all.</p>

<p>She could sing well and loudly, and she knew
all the 'canzoe' and 'stornelli' of the district
by heart; but there her knowledge stopped;
and no one had cared to instruct or enlighten
her more. Her own family thought the words
of the organist rubbish.</p>

<p>There are so many of these clear-voiced, flute-throated
girls and boys singing in their adolescence
in the fields and woods and highways;
but no one thinks anything of their carols, and
life and its travail tell on them and make them
hoarse, and their once liquid tones grow harsh
and rough from exposure to the weather, and
from calling so loudly from hill to hill to
summon their children, or their cattle, or their
comrades, home.</p>

<p>The human voice is a pipe soon broken.
The nightingale sings on and on and on, from
youth to age, and neither rain nor wind hurt his
throat; but men and women, in rough, rustic
lives, soon lose their gift of song. They sing
at all ages, indeed, over their furrows, their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
washing-tank, their yoked oxen, their plait of
straw or hank of flax; but the voice loses its
beauty as early as the skin its bloom.</p>

<p>Santina had no notion in what way she could
make hers a means to reach those distant parts
in which her fate was to await her if the cards
spake truly. Only to get away somewhere,
somehow, was her fixed idea; and she would
no more have married the sober, well-to-do
wheelwright her people picked out for her, than
she would have thrown her vigorous and virgin
body down the well.</p>

<p>'He shall get me the cards and the treasure
wand out of her grave before this moon is out,'
she said, between her white teeth, with which
she could crack nuts and bite through string
and grind the black bread into powder.</p>

<p>Caris took no definite shape in her eyes except
as an instrument to get her will and ways.
She was but a country girl just knowing her
letters, and no more; but the yeast of restless
ambition was fermenting in her.</p>

<p>She sat staring at the moon, while the tired
children slept as motionless as plucked poppies.
The moon was near its full. Before it waned
she swore to herself that she would have Lisabetta's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>
magic tools in her hands. Could she
only know more, or else get money! She was
ignorant, but she knew that money was power.
With money she could get away over those
hills which seemed drawn like a screen between
her fate and her.</p>

<p>Marry Matteo! She laughed aloud, and
thought the face in the moon laughed too.</p>

<p>The outfit was made, the pearls were bought,
the 'stimatore' who is called in to appraise
every article of a marriage corredo had fingered
and weighed and adjudged the cost of every
single thing, and the wheelwright had bought
the bed and the furniture, and many other
matters not usual or incumbent on a bridegroom,
and her parents had said that such
a warm man and so liberal a one was never
seen in their day: and very little time was
there now left wherein she could escape her
fate.</p>

<p>All unwillingness on her part would have
been regarded by her parents as an insanity,
and would have only seemed to her bridegroom
as the spice which is added to the stewed hare.
There was no chance for her but to use this
single fortnight which she had been allowed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
spend in farewell at the four roads of Genistrello.</p>

<p>Her uncle and aunt had helped generously
in the getting together of the corredo; and
their wish to have her with them had been at
once conceded. Her parents were poor, and
the woodsman was rich as rubies are esteemed,
amongst the oak scrub and chestnut saplings of
the Pistoiese Apennines.</p>

<p>The Massaio people liked her and indulged
her; but had they dreamed that she meant to
elude her marriage they would have dragged
her by the hair of her head, or kicked her with
the soles of their hob-nailed boots down the
hillside into her father's house, and given her
up to punishment without pity, as they would
have given a runaway horse or dog.</p>

<p>The day for the ceremony had not been fixed,
for in this country, where love intrigues speed
by as swift as lightning, matrimonial contracts
move slowly and cautiously; but the word was
passed, the goods were purchased, the house
was ready; and to break a betrothal at such a
point would have been held a crime and a
disgrace.</p>

<p>Santina herself knew that; she was well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
aware that decent maidens do not do such things
when the dower clothing and linen are all
stitched, and the marriage-bed bought by the
bridegroom. She knew, but she did not care.
She was headstrong, changeable, vain and full
of thirst for pleasure and for triumph and for
wealth. She would not pass her life in her
little native town, in the wheelwright's old house
with a jealous rheumatic curmudgeon, for all
the saints in heaven and all the friends on earth.</p>

<p>'Not I! Not I! Oh, why did Lisabetta
go underground for ever with half the cards
unread?' she thought, as she sat upon her
couch of sacking and dry maize leaves, and she
shook her clenched hands at the moon with
anger at its smiling indifference. The moon
could sail where it chose and see what it liked;
and she was chained down here by her youth,
and her sex, and her ignorance, and her poverty;
and her only one faint hope of escape and aid
lay in the closed grave of a dead old woman.</p>

<p>Though she was voluble and garrulous and
imprudent and passionate, she could keep her
own counsel.</p>

<p>Under her Tuscan volubility there was also
the Tuscan secretiveness. Nobody saw inside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
her true thoughts. Her mind was like a little
locked iron box into which no one could peep.</p>

<p>The Tuscan laughs quickly, weeps quickly,
rages, fumes, smiles, jumps with joy; seems a
merely emotional creature, with his whole heart
turned inside out; but in his inmost nature
there is always an ego wholly different to that
which is shown to others, always a deep reserve
of unspoken intents and calculations and desires.</p>

<p>It resembles a rosebush all bloom and dew
and leaf and sunshine, inside which is made the
nest of a little snake, never seen, but always
there; sometimes, instead of the snake, there is
only a flat stone; but something alien there
always is under the carelessly blowing roses.</p>

<p>The Tuscan never completely trusts his
nearest or dearest, his oldest friend, his truest
companion, his fondest familiar; be he gentle
or simple, he never gives himself away.</p>

<p>The homeliest son and daughter of the soil
will always act as though he or she were
cognizant of the axiom of the fine philosopher
of courts: 'Deal with your friend at all times as
though some day he would become your enemy.'</p>

<p>Santina, therefore, had told her secret intent
to no living soul, and only Caris's old weird<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
mother had been shrewd enough to guess it in
the girl's flashing eyes and in her eager questioning
of Fate.</p>

<p>The house of Massaio was a very busy house,
especially so at this season of the year, when
the purchasing and fetching and stacking of
wood for the coming winter was in full vigour,
and all the boys and girls were up in the woods
all day long, seeking out and bringing down
brushwood and pines and cut heather.</p>

<p>Santina with wonderful alacrity entered into
the work, although usually she was averse to
rough labour, fearing that it would spoil her
hands and her skin before she could get to that
unknown life of delight which she coveted.</p>

<p>But going with the heedless and unobservant
children up on the hillsides where the heather
and chestnut scrub grew, and farther up still
where the tall stone pines grew, she had chances
of meeting Caris or of again getting away to his
hut unnoticed. He was usually at this season
occupied in carrying wood or helping the charcoal-burners,
and was now in one place, now in
another, as men who have no fixed labour
must be.</p>

<p>Moreover, her just estimate of her own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
attraction for him made her guess that this
year he would choose to labour nearer the four
roads than usual, if he could get employment,
and she was in no manner surprised when she
saw him amongst a group of men who were
pulling at the ropes of one of her uncle's wood-carts,
to prevent the cart and the mules harnessed
to it from running amuck down the
steep incline which led to that green nook at
the foot of Genistrello, where the woodman's
buildings and sheds were situated.</p>

<p>She gave him a sidelong glance and a shy
smile as she passed them, and Caris, colouring
to the roots of his hair, let his rope slacken and
fall, and was sworn at fiercely by his fellow-labourers,
for the cart lurched, and one of the
wheels sunk up to its hub in the soft wet
sand.</p>

<p>'Get away, lass!' shouted the carter roughly.
'Where women are men's work is always
fouled.'</p>

<p>'You unmannerly churl!' shouted Caris; and
he struck the carter sharply across the shoulders
with his end of the rope.</p>

<p>The man flung himself round and tried to
strike his assailant in return with the thong of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
his long mule-whip; but Caris caught it in his
grip and closed with him.</p>

<p>They wrestled savagely for a moment, then
the carter, freeing his right arm, snatched out of
his breeches belt the knife which every man
carries, however severely the law may denounce
and forbid such a habit. It would have buried
its sharp, narrow blade in the ribs or the breast
of Caris had not the other men, at a shout from
Massaio, who came hurrying up, thrown themselves
on the two combatants, and pulled them
apart.</p>

<p>'To &mdash;&mdash; with you both!' cried Massaio,
furious to see his cart stuck in the sand, its
load of wood oscillating, and the time wasted of
men whom he paid by the day.</p>

<p>Santina had stood quietly on the bank above
the mules and the men, watching with keen
interest and pleasure.</p>

<p>'Why did you stop them, uncle?' she cried
to Massaio pettishly. 'I do love to see two
good lads fight. 'Tis a sight that warms one's
blood like good communion wine.'</p>

<p>But no one heeded what she said.</p>

<p>On these hills women are used but never
listened to by any man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
'The cows give milk, not opinions,' the men
said to their womenkind.</p>

<p>Only Caris had seen in the sunlight that lithe
erect figure amongst the gorse, and those two
burning, melting, shining eyes, which had incited
him to combat.</p>

<p>He was deeply angered with Massaio for
stopping the duello.</p>

<p>A knife? What mattered a knife? He
had one, too, in his breeches band; in another
second he, too, would have had his out, and
then Santina would have seen work fit for a
brave, bold woman to watch, with the red blood
running merrily through the thirsty sand and
the tufted heather.</p>

<p>He was not quarrelsome or bloodthirsty; but
any man who goes down into Maremma through
the 'macchia,' where the 'mal-viventi' hide,
learns to know very well how to sell his own
life dearly, and hold the lives of others cheaply;
and these contraband knives, which the law
forbids so uselessly, cost very little to buy,
and yet do their work surely, quickly, and well.</p>

<p>He cast one longing look up at Santina
standing above amongst the gorse, and moved
on sullenly with the other men and the mule,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>
when the cart with rare effort had been pulled
erect and dragged out of the sand. It was then
only an hour or two after daybreak.</p>

<p>The day came and ended without Caris seeing
his goddess again.</p>

<p>During the repose at noontide, when he with
others broke bread and ate soup at the big table
in Massaio's kitchen, she was not there. They
were served by her aunt Eufemia. He had
only accepted this work of fetching and stacking
for sake of the vicinity to her which it
offered; and his heart was heavy and his
blood was turned, as he would himself have
expressed it.</p>

<p>Chagrin and irritation, in the Italian's opinion,
turns the blood as tempest changes milk. He
was too shy and tongue-tied to venture to inquire
for her; and the instinct of secrecy which
characterizes all passion was joined to his
natural hesitation in speech.</p>

<p>Massaio's people seemed, too, to him to be
very grand folks, with their byres and stalls
filled with beasts, and their casks of wine and
great earthen jars of oil standing there for anybody
to read in mute declaration of their prosperity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>
A barrel of wine had never entered the hut of
the Lascarises within the memory of man. No
one took any notice of him. He was a 'bracciante,'
paid by the day, nothing more. Had
Eufemia known that he was the old witch's
son he would have attracted her attention; but
she did not know it. When there is quick
rough work to be done, nobody notices who
does it.</p>

<p>When the last wood of the day was brought
in, Caris went home by himself, by ways he
knew. He was downcast and dull. He had
been baulked of his knife-play with the carter,
and he had not seen Santina.</p>

<p>At a bend in the hill-path, where the chestnut
saplings grew taller than usual, and aged pines
with scaly scarred trunks were left standing, he
heard a laugh amongst the leafy scrub, and in
the dusk of the moonless evening a slender
straight figure shot up from its screen of
heather.</p>

<p>'Eh, Caris!' cried the girl to him. 'What a
poor day's work! Have you left Black Simon
without an inch of steel in him? Fie for shame!
A man should always write his name large when
he has a stiletto for his pen.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
Caris gazed at her dumb and agitated, the
veins in his throat and temples throbbing.</p>

<p>'It was your uncle stopping the play,' he
muttered; 'and I could not begin to brawl in his
house.'</p>

<p>Santina shrugged her shoulders. 'Brave men
don't want excuses,' she said unkindly.</p>

<p>'Ask of me in Maremma,' said Caris sullenly.
'They will tell you whether men taste my
blade.'</p>

<p>'Maremma is far,' said Santina, sarcastic and
jeering; 'and the men there are weak!'</p>

<p>'You shall see what you shall see,' muttered
Caris, growing purple, red, and then pale.
'Tell me a man you have a quarrel with&mdash;nay,
one who stands well with you&mdash;that will be
better.'</p>

<p>'Those are words,' she said, with curt contempt.</p>

<p>'You shall see deeds. Who is it stands well
with you?'</p>

<p>'No one. Many wish it.'</p>

<p>'Your promised man should; but he is old,
and a poor creature. 'Twould be no credit to
do away with him.'</p>

<p>'He is a poor creature,' said Santina, her lips<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
curling. 'So are you, when to do a woman a
pleasure you will not open a grave.'</p>

<p>'Open a grave! Nay, nay, the saints forbid.'</p>

<p>'The saints! That is how all weaklings and
cowards talk. What harm could it do any
saint in heaven for you to get those magic
things? If they be the devil's toys and tools,
as you say, more reason to pluck them out of
holy ground.'</p>

<p>'How you go on!' muttered Caris, whose
slower brain was scared and terrified by his
companion's rapid and fearless strides of thought.
'Heaven have mercy on us! You would have
me commit sacrilege! Rifle a tomb! Holy
Christ! and that tomb my mother's!'</p>

<p>The sweat stood on his brow, and made the
chestnut curls of his hair wet as with dew or rain.</p>

<p>Santina poured into his all the magnetic force
and fire of her own eyes, shining in the dusk
like some wild cat of the woods.</p>

<p>'Sacrilege! whew! Where got you that big
word? You put the things in; you can take
the things out. Your mother will sleep sounder
without them. I want them, my lad, do you
understand? I want them. And what I want<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
I get from those who love me; and those who
deny me, hate me, and I hate them.'</p>

<p>Caris shuddered as he heard.</p>

<p>'I love you,' he stammered. 'Do not hate
me&mdash;for pity's sake, do not hate me.'</p>

<p>'Obey me, then,' she said, with her dark
level brows contracting over her luminous eyes.</p>

<p>'In anything else!'</p>

<p>'Oh, ay! It is always anything else, except
the one thing which is wanted!'</p>

<p>'But what is it you want?'</p>

<p>'I want the charms and the wand and the
book out of your mother's grave.'</p>

<p>'What could you do with them? Without
the knowledge, they are no more than a dry
twig and a few dirty play-cards.'</p>

<p>'How know you what knowledge I have? I
want the things, that is all, I tell you.'</p>

<p>'They were accursed if they had any use in
them. And what use had they? She who
understood them lived and died all but a
beggar. If they had any power in them, they
cheated and starved her.'</p>

<p>The speech was a long one for Caris, whose
thoughts were so little used to fit themselves to
utterance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
Santina heard him with the passionate impatience
and intolerance of a swift mind with a
dull one, of a bold will with a timid nature.</p>

<p>She had set her soul on possessing these magic
things; she was convinced that she should find
the way to make them work; superstition was
intense and overwhelming in her, and allied to a
furious ambition, all the more powerful because
given loose rein through her complete ignorance.</p>

<p>'Oh, you white-livered ninny!' she cried to
him, with boundless scorn. 'Would to Heaven
Black Simon had buried his blade into you!
It would have rid the earth of a dolt and a
dastard!'</p>

<p>'Then let me be, if I be worth so little,'
said Caris sullenly, whilst his eyes devoured
her beauty half seen in the darkness which
preceded the late rising of the moon. Then
she saw that she had mistaken her path, and
she changed it. She let great tears come into
her eyes, and her mouth trembled, and her
bosom heaved.</p>

<p>'This was the lad I could have loved!' she
murmured. 'This was the strong bold youth
whom I thought would be my brave and bonny
damo before all the countryside. Oh, what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
fools are women&mdash;what fools!&mdash;taken by the
eye, with a falcon glance and a sheaf of nut-brown
curls and a broad breast that looks as if
the heart of a true man beat in it. Oh, woe is
me! Oh, woe is me! I dreamed a dream, and
it has no more truth in it than the slate shingle
here has of silver.'</p>

<p>She kicked downward scornfully as she spoke
the crumbling slate and mia which showed
here and there betwixt the heather plants in the
tremulous shadow relics of a quarry worked
long centuries before, and forsaken when the
fires of the camp of Hun and Goth had blazed
upon those hillsides.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span></p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>Caris stared at her as she spoke, his whole
frame thrilling and all his senses alive as they
had never been before under a woman's glamour.
He heeded not the derision, he thought not of
the strangeness of the avowal; delicacy is not
often a plant which grows in uncultured soil,
and he had none of the intuition and suspicion
which an educated man would have been moved
by before such an avowal and such an upbraiding.
He only knew, or thought he
was bidden to know, that he had the power
in him to please her fancy and awaken her
desire.</p>

<p>'You love me! You can love me!' he shouted
in a loud, vibrating, exultant voice which wakened
all the echoes of the hills around him, and he
sprang forward to seize her in his arms. But
Santina, agile and strong, pushed him back, and
stood aloof.</p>

<p>'Nay, nay, stand off!' she cried to him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
'Ne'er a coward shall touch me. All I said
was, you might have won me.'</p>

<p>'I am no coward,' said Caris hotly. 'And
why do you fool and tempt one so? 'Tis unfair.
'Tis unfair. You may rue it.'</p>

<p>His face was convulsed, his eyes were aflame,
he breathed like a bull in a hard combat.</p>

<p>Santina smiled; that was how she liked to see
a man look.</p>

<p>She had all the delight in watching and weighing
the effects of the passion which she excited
that moved the great queens of Asia and the
empresses of Rome. She was only a poor girl,
but the love of dominance and the violence of
the senses were in her strong and hot and
reckless.</p>

<p>In her was all that ferment of ambition and
vanity and discontent which drives out from
their hamlets those who are born with something
in them different to their lot and alien to
their fellows. She had never been anywhere
farther afield than the hills and woods about
Pistanse, but she knew that there were big cities
somewhere, where men were made of money,
and women wore satin all day long, and everybody
ate and drank out of gold plates and silver<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>
vessels. She knew that; and to get to these
kingdoms of delight was the one longing which
possessed her day and night.</p>

<p>She wanted to get one thing out of this man&mdash;the
means of liberty&mdash;and she cared nothing
how she won it. Besides, he was so simple, so
malleable, so credulous, it diverted her to play
on him as one could play on a chitarra, making
the strings leap and sigh and thrill and groan.
And he was good to look at, too, with his
tanned, fresh face, and his clustering curls,
and his strong, straight, cleanly limbs.</p>

<p>'I only said you might have won me,' she
repeated&mdash;'nay, you may still, if you have
the heart of a man and not of a mouse.
Hearken!'</p>

<p>'Do not fool me,' said Caris sternly, 'or as
the Lord lives above us&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>She laughed airily.</p>

<p>'Oh, big oaths cannot frighten me. It shall
lie with you. I want those things of your
mother's. When you bring them I will thank
you&mdash;as you choose.'</p>

<p>He grew gray under his brown, bright
skin.</p>

<p>'Always that,' he muttered&mdash;always that!'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>
'Naturally, it is what I want.'</p>

<p>'Go, get them, since you think it holy
work.'</p>

<p>'I will,' said Santina, 'and then good-night
to you, my good Caris; you will never see me
more.'</p>

<p>She turned on her heel and began to run
down the slope in the moonlight.</p>

<p>Santina would not have ventured inside the
graveyard at night to get mountains of gold.
She would not have passed after nightfall within
a mile of its gate without crossing herself and
murmuring Aves all the way. Superstition was
born and bred in every inch of her bone and
every drop of her blood, and she would no
more have carried out her threat than she would
have carried the mountain upon her shoulders.</p>

<p>But he did not know that. She was so bold,
so careless, so self-confident, if she had told him
she would split open the earth to its centre he
would have believed her.</p>

<p>He overtook her as she fled down the slope
and seized her in his arms.</p>

<p>'No, no!' he cried, close in her ear. 'It is
not work for you. If it must be done I will
do it. Will you swear that you will give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>
yourself to me if I bring you the unholy
things?'</p>

<p>'I love you!' she said breathlessly, while her
lips brushed his throat&mdash;'yes, I do love you!
Go, get the things, and bring them hither at
dawn. I will meet you. Oh, I will find the
way to use them, never fear. That is my
business. Get you gone. They are calling
below. They shut the house at the twenty-four.'</p>

<p>No one was calling, but she wished to get rid
of him. He was strong, and he was on fire
with her touch and her glance; he strained
her in his arms until her face was bruised
against the hairy sinews and bones of his chest.</p>

<p>She thrust him away with a supreme effort,
and ran down the stony side of the hill, and
was swallowed up in the duskiness of the
tangled scrub.</p>

<p>A little scops owl flitted past, uttering its
soft, low note, which echoes so far and long in
the silence of evening in the hills.</p>

<p>Caris shook himself like a man who has been
half stunned by a heavy fall. He was on fire
with the alcohol of passion, and chilled to the
marrow by the promise he had made.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>
Open a tomb! Rifle a grave! See his
mother again in her cere clothes&mdash;see all the
untold and untellable horrors of which the dead
and the earth make their secrets!</p>

<p>Oh, why had he ever admitted that he had
sealed up the uncanny things in the coffin!
He could have bitten his tongue out for its
tell-tale folly.</p>

<p>He had thrust them in almost without consciousness
of his act as he had hammered the
lid down on the deal shell all alone with it
in his cabin.</p>

<p>The things had been always under his
mother's pillow at night; it had seemed to
him that they ought to go with her down to
the grave. He had had a secret fear of them,
and he had thought that their occult powers
would be nullified once thrust in sacred soil.
He had been afraid to burn them.</p>

<p>The churchyard in which his mother lay was
on the topmost slope of Genistrello, where the
brown brick tower of the massive medieval
church of St. Fulvo rose amongst the highest
pines, upon a wind-swept and storm-scarred
scarp.</p>

<p>Few were the dead who were taken there;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>
meagre and miserable were the lot and the
pittance of its poor Vicar, and weather-beaten
and worn by toil were the score of peasants
who made up its congregation, coming thence
from the scattered huts and farmhouses of the
hillside.</p>

<p>It was seven miles off from the chestnut
wood where he dwelt, and twice seven from the
four roads; a lonely and not over-safe tramp
across the hills and the water-courses and the
brushwood.</p>

<p>But it was not the distance which troubled
him, nor any possible danger. He knew his
way through all that country, and the full round
moon was by now showing her broad disc over
the edge of the farther mountains on the south-east.
But the thought of what he would have
to do at the end of his pilgrimage made him
sick with fear not altogether unmanly.</p>

<p>He knew that what he would do would be
sacrilege and punishable by law, but it was not
of that he thought: his mind was filled with
those terrors of the nether world, of the unknown,
of the unseen, which a lonely life and a
latent imagination made at once so indistinct
and so powerful to him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>
'Had she but asked me anything else! 'he
thought piteously. 'Anything!&mdash;to cut off
my right hand or to take the life of any man!'</p>

<p>But she had set him this task; inexorably as
women of old set their lovers to search for the
Grail or beard the Saracen in his mosque, and
he knew that he must do what she willed or
never again feel those warm red lips breathe on
his own.</p>

<p>He tightened the canvas belt round his loins,
and went home to his cabin to fetch a pickaxe
and a spade, and, bidding his dog stay to guard
the empty hut, he set out to walk across the
vast steep breadth of woodland darkness which
separated him from the church and churchyard
which were his goal.</p>

<p>A labourer on those hills all his life, and
accustomed also to the more perilous and murderous
thickets of Maremma, where escaped
galley-slaves hid amongst the boxwood and the
bearberry, and lived in caves and hollow trees,
no physical alarm moved him as he strode on
across the uneven ground with the familiar
scents and sounds of a woodland night around
him on every side.</p>

<p>The moon had now risen so high that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
valleys were bathed in her light, and the sky
was radiant with a brilliancy which seemed but
a more ethereal day.</p>

<p>He had no eyes for its beauty. His whole
soul was consumed by the horror of his errand.
He only looked up at the pointers and the pole-star
which he knew, so as to guide himself by
them up the steep slopes to the church, for he
had left the cart-tracks and mule-paths and
struck perforce through the gorse and undergrowth
westward, gradually ascending as he
went.</p>

<p>'Poor mother! poor mother!' he kept saying
to himself. It seemed horrible to him to go
and molest her out in her last sleep and take
those things which were buried with her.
Would she know? Would she awake? Would
she rise and strike him?</p>

<p>Then he thought of a dead woman whom he
had found once in the 'macchia' in Maremma,
lying unburied under some myrtle bushes; he
remembered how hideous she had looked, how
the ants and worms had eaten her, how the wild
boars had gnawed her flesh, how the jaws had
grinned and the empty eyeballs had stared, and
how a black toad had sat on her breast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>
Would his mother look like that?</p>

<p>No; for she was safe under ground, under
sacred ground, shut up secure from wind and
weather in that deal shell which he had himself
made and hammered down; and she was in her
clothes, all neat and proper, and the holy oil
had been upon her.</p>

<p>No, she had been put in her grave like a
Christian, witch though they said that she was.
She could not look like the woman in Maremma,
who had been a vagrant and a gipsy.</p>

<p>Yet he was afraid&mdash;horribly afraid.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span></p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>It was a soft and luminous night; there was
the faintest of south winds now and then
wandering amongst the tops of the pines, and
fanning their aromatic odours out of them.
The sound of little threads of water trickling
through the sand and moss, and falling downward
through the heather, was the only sound,
save when a night bird called through the dark,
or a night beetle whirred on its way.</p>

<p>The summit of the hillside was sere and arid,
and its bold stony expanse had seldom a living
thing on it by daylight. By night, when the
priest and sacristan of St. Fulvo were sleeping,
there was not a single sign of any life, except
the blowing of the pine-tops in the breeze.</p>

<p>He had never been there except by broad
day; his knees shook under him as he looked
up at the tall straight black tower, with the
moonlit clouds shining through the bars of its
open belfry. If he had not heard the voice of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>
Santina crying to him, 'No coward shall win
me,' he would have turned and fled.</p>

<p>He was alone as utterly as though all the
world were dead.</p>

<p>It was still barely midnight when he saw the
bell-tower on high looming darker than the dark
clouds about it, and the pine-trees and the
presbytery and the walls of the burial-ground
gathered round it black and gaunt, their shapes
all fused together in one heap of gloom.</p>

<p>The guardians of the place, old men who
went early to their beds, were sleeping somewhere
under those black roofs against the
tower. Below, the hills and valleys were all
wrapped in the silence of the country night.</p>

<p>On some far road a tired team of charcoal-bearing
mules might be treading woefully to the
swing of their heavy bells, or some belated string
of wine-carts might be creeping carefully through
the darkness, the men half-drunk and their
beasts half-asleep.</p>

<p>But there was no sound or sign of them in
the vast brooding stillness which covered like
great soft wings the peaceful hills overlapping
one another, and the serenity of the mountains
bathed in the rays of the moon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>
There was no sound anywhere: not even the
bleat of a sheep from the flocks, nor the bark of
a dog from the homesteads.</p>

<p>Caris crossed himself, and mounted the steep
path which led to the church-gate.</p>

<p>The last time he had come thither he had
climbed up with the weight of his mother's
coffin on his shoulders; the ascent being too
steep for a mule to mount and he too poor to
pay for assistance.</p>

<p>The walls of the graveyard were high, and
the only access to it was through a wooden
iron-studded door, which had on one side of it
a little hollowed stone for holy water, and above
it a cross of iron and an iron crown. To force
the door was impossible; to climb the wall was
difficult, but he was agile as a wild cat, and
accustomed to crawl up the stems of the pines
to gather their cones, and the smooth trunks
of the poplars in the valleys to lop their
crowns.</p>

<p>He paused a moment, feeling the cold dews
run like rain off his forehead, and wished that
his dog was with him, a childish wish, for the
dog could not have climbed: then he kicked off
his boots, set his toe-nails in the first crevice in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>
the brick surface, and began to mount with his
hands and feet with prehensile agility.</p>

<p>In a few moments he was above on the broad
parapet which edged the wall, and could look
down into the burial-place below. But he did
not dare to look; he shut his eyes convulsively
and began to descend, holding by such slight
aids as the uneven surface and the projecting
lichens afforded him. He dropped at last
roughly but safely on the coarse grass within
the enclosure.</p>

<p>All was black and still; the graveyard was
shut in on three sides by its walls, and at the
fourth side by the tower of the church.</p>

<p>The moon had passed behind a cloud and he
could see nothing.</p>

<p>He stood ankle-deep in the grass; and as he
stirred he stumbled over the uneven broken
ground, made irregular by so many nameless
graves. He felt in his breeches pockets for his
pipe and matches, and drew one of the latter
out and struck it on a stone.</p>

<p>But the little flame was too feeble to show
him even whereabouts he was, and he could
not in the darkness tell one grave from
another.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>
Stooping and stretching out his hands, he
could feel the rank grass and the hillocks all
round him; there were a few head-stones, but
only a few; of such dead as were buried in the
graveyard of St. Fulvo, scarce one mourner in a
century could afford a memorial stone or even
a wooden cross.</p>

<p>He stood still and helpless, not having
foreseen the difficulty of the darkness.</p>

<p>He could feel the stirring of wings in the air
around him. His sense told him that they
were but owls and bats, of which the old tower
was full; but he shivered as he heard them go
by; who could be sure what devilish thing they
might not be?</p>

<p>The horror of the place grew on him.</p>

<p>Still, harmless, sacred though it was, it filled
him with a terror which fastened upon him,
making his eyeballs start, and his flesh creep,
and his limbs shake beneath him.</p>

<p>Yet he gripped his pickaxe closer and tighter,
and held his ground, and waited for the moon
to shine from the clouds.</p>

<p>Santina should see he was no white-livered
boy. He would get her what she asked, and
then she would be his&mdash;his&mdash;his; and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>
woods would hide their loves and the cold moss
grow warm with their embrace.</p>

<p>Stung into courage and impatience by her
memory, he struck violently upon one of the
stones his whole handful of brimstone matches;
they flared alight with a blue, sharp flash, and
he saw there at his feet his mother's grave.</p>

<p>He could not doubt that it was hers; it was
a mound of clay on which no grass had had
time to grow, and there were the cross-sticks
he had set up on it as a memorial, with a bit of
an old blue kerchief which had been hers tied
to them.</p>

<p>It was just as he had left them there four
months before, when the summer had been
green and the brooks dry and the days long and
light. She was there under his feet where he
and the priest had laid her, the two crossed
chestnut sticks the only memorial she would
ever have, poor soul!</p>

<p>She was there, lying out in all wind and
weather alone&mdash;horribly, eternally alone; the
rain raining on her and the sun shining on her,
and she knowing nought, poor, dead woman!</p>

<p>Then the wickedness of what he came to do
smote him all of a sudden so strongly that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>
staggered as under a blow, and a shower of hot
tears gushed from his eyes, and he wept
bitterly.</p>

<p>'Oh, mother, poor mother!' he cried aloud.</p>

<p>She had been a hard mother to him, and had
had ways which he had feared and disliked, and
a cruel tongue and a bad name on the hillside,
but she had been his mother, and when she had
lain dying she had been sorrowful to think that
she would leave him alone.</p>

<p>She had been his mother, and he came to
rifle her grave.</p>

<p>What a crime! What a foul, black crime,
such as men and women would scarce speak of
with bated breath by their hearths in the full
blaze of day! What a crime! He abhorred
himself for doing it, as he would have abhorred
a poisoner or a parricide seeing them pass to the
gallows.</p>

<p>'Oh, mother, mother, forgive me! She
will have it so!' he sobbed with a piteous
prayer.</p>

<p>He thought that, being dead, his mother
would understand and forgive, as she would
never have understood or forgiven when living.</p>

<p>Then he struck his spade down into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>
heavy clay on which no bird-sown seed of blade
or blossom had yet had any time to spring.</p>

<p>He dug and dug and dug, till the sweat
rolled off his limbs and his shoulders ached and
his arms quivered.</p>

<p>He threw spadefuls of clay one after another
out on the ground around, his eyes growing
used to the darkness, and his hands gripping
the spade handle harder and harder in desperation.
The very horror of his action nerved
him to feverish force.</p>

<p>'Oh, Santina, Santina, you give my soul to
hell fires everlasting!' he cried aloud once, as
he jammed the iron spade down deeper and
deeper into the ground, tearing the stiff soil
asunder and crushing the stones.</p>

<p>The moon came forth from the clouds, and
the burial-ground grew white with her light
where the shadows of the wall did not fall.
He looked up once; then he saw black crosses,
black skulls and cross-bones, rank grass, crumbling
headstones, nameless mounds all round
him, and beyond them the tower of the church.</p>

<p>But his mother's coffin he did not find. In
vain he dug, and searched, and frantically
tossed aside the earth in such haste to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>
have ended and finished with his horrible
task.</p>

<p>His mother's coffin he could not find.</p>

<p>Under the rays of the moon the desecrated
ground lay, all broken up and heaped and
tossed together, as though an earthquake had
riven the soil. But the deal shell which he had
made with his own hands and borne thither on
his own shoulders, he could not find.</p>

<p>'She will never believe! she will never believe!'
he thought.</p>

<p>Santina would never believe that he had
come there if he met her at dawn with empty
hands. He could hear in fancy her shrill, cruel,
hissing shriek of mockery and derision; and he
felt that if he did so hear it in reality it would
drive him mad.</p>

<p>He dug, and dug, and dug, more furiously,
more blindly, going unconsciously farther and
farther away from where the two crossed chestnut
sticks had been; they had been uprooted
and buried long before under the first heap
of clay which he had thrown out from the
grave.</p>

<p>He had forgotten that they alone were his
landmarks and guides; in the darkness which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>
had been followed by the uncertain, misleading
light of the moon, he had gone far from them.</p>

<p>His work had become almost a frenzy with
him; his nerves were strung to an uncontrollable
pitch of excitation, fear, and horror,
and obstinacy, and a furious resolve to obtain
what he sought, with a terrible dread of what
he should see when he should reach it, had
together, in their conflict of opposing passions,
driven him beside himself.</p>

<p>He dug on and on, without any consciousness
of how far he had gone from his goal, and
no sense left but the fury of determination to
possess himself of what he knew was there in
the earth beneath him.</p>

<p>He stood up to his knees in the yawning
clay, with the heavy clods of it flung up on
either side of him, and the moon hanging up
on high in the central heavens, her light often
obscured by drifting cloud wrack, and at other
times shining cold and white into his face, as
though by its searching rays to read his soul.</p>

<p>How long he had been there he knew not;
time was a blank to him; his supernatural
terrors were lost in the anguish of dread lest
he should be unable to do Santina's will.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>
He felt as though he strove with the fiend
himself.</p>

<p>Who but some hideous power of evil could
have moved the corpse and baffled and beaten
him thus? Perhaps truly the charms had been
things born of the devil, and the devil had
taken them both to himself, and the body of his
mother with them. He dug on and on frantically,
deriving relief from the fever within him
through that violent exertion which strained
every vein and muscle in his body, till he felt
as though beaten with iron rods.</p>

<p>He did not see, in the confusion of his mind
and the gloom of the night, that he had come
close under the graveyard wall, and was digging
almost at its base. He believed himself still to
be on the spot where he had buried his mother;
and he had deepened the pit about him until he
was sunk up to his loins. He never remembered
the danger of the priest or the sacristan
waking and rising and seeing him at his occult
labour.</p>

<p>He never remembered that the bell would
toll for matins whilst the stars would be still in
their places, and the hills and the valleys still
dark. All sense had left him except one set,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>
insane resolve to obtain that by which the
beauty of a woman was alone to be won.</p>

<p>Of crime he had grown reckless, of emotion
he had none left; he was only frantically,
furiously determined to find that which he had
come to seek. Standing in the damp, clogging
soil, with the sense of moving creatures about
him which his labours had disturbed in the bowels
of the earth, he dug and dug and dug until his
actions had no purpose or direction in them,
only hurling clod upon clod in breathless, aimless,
senseless monotony and haste.</p>

<p>At last his spade struck on some substance
other than the heavy soil and the slimy worms;
he thrilled through all his frame with triumph
and with terror.</p>

<p>At last! At last! He never doubted that
it was the coffin he sought; he did not know
that his mother's grave lay actually yards away
from him. Oh, were there only light, he
thought; it was so dark, for the moon had now
passed down behind the wall of the graveyard,
and there would be only henceforth growing
ever darker and darker that dense gloom which
precedes the dawn. He dared not go on
digging; he was afraid that the iron of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span>
spade should stave in the soft wood of the coffin,
and cut and maim the body within it. He
stooped and pushed the clay aside with his
hands, trying to feel what the tool had struck.</p>

<p>What met his touch was not wood, but
metal&mdash;rounded, smooth, polished; though
clogged and crusted with the clay-bed in which
it lay. He pushed the earth farther and farther
away, and the object he had reached seemed to
lie far down, under the soil, and to be held
down by it.</p>

<p>He was himself hemmed in by the broken
clods, and stood in the hole he had dug, half
imprisoned by it. But he could move enough
to strike a few remaining matches on the iron
of the spade, and let their light fall on what he
had unearthed.</p>

<p>Then it seemed to him that a miracle had
been wrought.</p>

<p>Before him lay a silver image of the Child
Christ. His knees shook, his whole frame
trembled, his lips gasped for breath; the flame
of the matches died out; he was left in the dark
with the image.</p>

<p>'It is the Gesu! It is the Gesu!' he
muttered, sure that his dead mother, or the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>
saints, or both, had wrought this miracle to
show him the evil of his ways.</p>

<p>In truth, the statue had lain there many
centuries, buried against the wall by pious
hands in times when the torch of war had been
carried flaming over all the wasted villages and
ravaged fields in the plain below.</p>

<p>But no such explanation dawned on the mind
of Caris.</p>

<p>To him it was a miracle wrought by the
saints or by the dead. In the dark he could
feel its round shoulders, its small hands folded
as in prayer, its smooth cheek and brow, its
little breast; and he touched them reverently,
trembling in every nerve.</p>

<p>He had heard of holy images shown thus to
reward belief or to confound disbelief.</p>

<p>His faith was vague, dull, foolish, but it was
deep-rooted in him. He was a miserable sinner;
and the dead and the saints turned him thus
backward on his road to hell; so he thought,
standing waist-deep in the rugged clay and
clutching his spade to keep himself from falling
in a swoon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span></p>

<h3>V</h3>

<p>To Caris miracles were as possible as daily
bread.</p>

<p>He knew little of them, but he believed in
them with his whole soul. It seemed wonderful
that the heavenly powers should create one for
such a poor and humble creature as himself;
but it did not seem in any way wonderful that
such a thing should be.</p>

<p>The Divine Child was there in the earth,
keeping away all evil things by its presence, and
he could not doubt that the saints who were
with Mary, or perchance his own mother's
purified spirit, had called the image there to
save him from the fiend.</p>

<p>He sank on his knees on the clay, and said
over breathlessly all the Aves he could think of
in his awe. They were few, but he repeated
them over and over again, hoping thus to find
grace and mercy for his sin for having broken
into these sacred precincts and disturbed the
dead in their rest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>
But what of Santina? Would she believe
him when he told her of this wondrous thing?</p>

<p>If he went to her with his hands empty,
would she ever credit that he had courage to
come upon this quest? He could hear, as it
were, at his ear, her mocking, cruel, incredulous
laughter.</p>

<p>She had said, 'Bring me the magic toys.'
What would the tale of a miracle matter to
her? She wanted treasure and knowledge.
She would care nothing for the souls of the
dead or the works of the saints&mdash;nothing.</p>

<p>He knew that her heart was set on getting
things which she knew were evil, but believed
were powerful for good and ill, for fate and
future.</p>

<p>Suddenly a thought which froze his veins
with its terror arose in him, and fascinated him
with its wickedness and his daring. What if
he took the holy image to her in proof that he
had tried to do her will, and had been turned
from his errand by powers more than mortal?</p>

<p>Since she had believed in the occult powers of
his mother's divining tools, surely she would
still more readily believe in the direct and visible
interposition of the dead?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>
If he bore the Gesu to her in his arms, she
could not then doubt that he had passed the
hours of this night in the graveyard of St.
Fulvo.</p>

<p>She could not, before its sacred testimony, be
angry, or scornful, or incredulous, or unkind.</p>

<p>But could he dare to touch the holy thing?
Would the image consent to be so taken?
Would not its limbs rebel, its lips open, its
body blister and blast the mortal hands which
would thus dare to desecrate it?</p>

<p>A new fear, worse, more unspeakable than
any which had moved him before, now took
possession of him as he knelt there on the
bottom of the pit which he had dug, gazing
through the blackness of the darkness to the
spot where he knew the silver body of the
Christ Child lay.</p>

<p>The thing was holy in his eyes, and he meant
to use it for unholy purposes. He felt that his
hands would wither at the wrist if they took up
that silver Gesu from its bed of earth.</p>

<p>His heart beat loudly against his ribs, his
head swam.</p>

<p>It was still dark, though dawn in the east had
risen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span>
He crawled out of the pit of clay with
difficulty, holding the silver image to his bosom
with one arm, and stood erect, and gazed
around him.</p>

<p>If saints or friends were there beside him, they
made no sign; they neither prevented nor
avenged the sacrilege.</p>

<p>The sweet, sharp smell of the wet blowing
grasses was in his nostrils, and the damp clinging
sods were about his feet, dragging at the
soles of his boots, that was all.</p>

<p>He began to think of the way in which he
could, thus burdened, climb the wall.</p>

<p>The silver Christ was heavy in his hold, and
he needed to have both hands free to ascend the
height above him.</p>

<p>He knew it was an image and not a living
god; yet none the less was it in his sight holy,
heaven-sent, miraculous, potent for the service
of the saints, and to take it up and bear it away
seemed to him like stealing the very Hostia
itself.</p>

<p>True, he would bring it back and give it to
the vicar, and let it, according to the reverend
man's choice, be returned to its grave or laid
on the altar of the church for the worship of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span>
the people, and the continued working of
miracles.</p>

<p>Yes, he said to himself, assuredly he would
bring it back. He would only bear it in his
arms most reverently to Santina, that she might
see and believe, and become his; and then he
would return hither with it and tell the priest
the wondrous story.</p>

<p>Yet he shook as with palsy at the thought of
carrying the blessed image as though it were a
mere living human babe.</p>

<p>It seemed to him as if no man could do such
a deed and live. The anointed hands of a priest
might touch it, but not his&mdash;his so hard and
rough and scarred with work, never having held
aught better than his pipe of clay and his tool
of wood or of iron, and the horn haft of his
pocket-knife.</p>

<p>Nor was even his motive for taking it pure.
He wanted through it to justify himself in the
sight of a woman, and to find favour with her,
and to gratify a strong and furious passion. His
reasons were earthly, gross, selfish; they could
not redeem, or consecrate, or excuse his act.
That he knew.</p>

<p>All was still, dusky, solitary; the church was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span>
wrapt in gloom, the daybreak did not reach it;
only above the inland hills the white light spread
where he could not see; behind the high wall of
the graveyard, beyond the ranges of the inland
hills, the gray soft light of daybreak had arisen.</p>

<p>He thought he heard voices all around him,
and amongst them that of his mother warning
him to leave untouched the sacred Child, and
get up on his feet and flee. But above these he
heard the laughter of Santina mocking him as
an empty-handed, white-livered fool, who came
with foolish tales of visions to hide his quaking
soul.</p>

<p>Better that his arms should shrivel, that his
sight should be blinded, that his body should
be shrunken and stricken with the judgment of
heaven, than that he should live to hear her red
lips laugh and call him a feckless coward.</p>

<p>With all the life which was in him shrinking
and sickening in deadly fear, he stooped down,
groped in the dark until he found the image,
grasped its metal breast and limbs, and dragged
it upward from the encircling earth.</p>

<p>It was of the size of a human child of a year
old.</p>

<p>He plucked it roughly upward, for his terror<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>
made him rude and fierce, and held it in his
arms, whilst he wondered in his great awe and
horror that no judgment of affronted heaven
followed on his desperate act.</p>

<p>All was still well with him; he saw, he heard,
he breathed, he lived; the cool night air was
blowing about him, the clouds were letting fall
a faint fine mist-like rain.</p>

<p>He undid the belt about his loins&mdash;a mere
piece of webbing with a buckle&mdash;strapped it
around the body of the Gesu, and taking the
ends thereof between his firm, strong teeth,
sought in the dark for the place whence he had
descended, and found it.</p>

<p>He climbed the wall with slow, laborious, and
painful effort, the dead weight of the silver figure
encumbering him as he mounted with cat-like
skill, cutting his hands and bruising his skin
against the rough, undressed stones.</p>

<p>He dropped carefully down on the earth
beneath, and began the descent of the hill.</p>

<p>'When I can bring the little Christ back, I
can get the tools,' he thought. It seemed a
small matter.</p>

<p>He was forced to leave behind him his spade
and pickaxe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span></p>

<h3>VI</h3>

<p>When at last he reached the top of the coping,
he saw that it was dawn. His heart leaped in
his breast. Down in the chestnut coppice
Santina would be awaiting him; and she would
believe&mdash;surely, certainly she would believe&mdash;when
she should see this holy Gesu brought out
from the tomb.</p>

<p>He was in good time. It was barely day.
He unslung the little Christ and took it again
in his arms, as carefully as a woman would take
a new-born child. The polished limbs grew
warm in his hands; its small face leaned against
his breast; he lost his awe of it; he ceased to
fear what it might do to him; he felt a kind of
love for it.</p>

<p>'Oh, Gesu, dear Gesu, smile on us!' he said
to it; and although it was still too dark to see
more than its outline faintly, he thought he saw
the mouth move in answer.</p>

<p>Holding it to him, he started homeward down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span>
the stony slope. He was thankful to be out of
that ghostly place of tombs; he was thankful
to have escaped from that scene of terror whole
in limb, and uncursed if unpardoned; the tension
of his nerves in the past hours had given
place to an unreasoning and overstrung gladness.
But for his reverence for the burden he
carried, he could have laughed aloud.</p>

<p>Only once now and then, as he went, his
conscience smote him. His poor mother!&mdash;he
had forgotten her; he had displaced the
mark set above her grave; no one would ever
now be sure where she was buried. Did it hurt
her, what he had done? Would she be jealous
in her grave of the woman for whom he did it?
Was it cruel to have come away without smoothing
the rugged earth above her bed and saying
an Ave for her?</p>

<p>But these thoughts, this remorse, were fleeting;
his whole mind was filled with the heat
of passion and its expectation. Fatigued and
overworked and sleepless as he was, he almost
ran down the paths of the hills in his haste, and
tore his skin and his clothes as he pushed his
way through the brushwood and furze, guarding
only the Gesu from hurt as he went.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>
The day had now fully dawned, and the sun
had risen; its rosy flush was warm over all the
land and sky; the woodlarks and the linnets
were singing under the bushes; the wild doves
were dabbling in the rivulets of water; the
hawks were circling high in the light.</p>

<p>On the wooded hillside all was peaceful with
the loveliness of the unworn day; the air was
full of the smell of heather and wet mosses and
resinous pine-cones; rain was falling above
where the church was, but in these lower woods
there was a burst of sunrise warmth and light.
None of these things, however, did he note. He
went on and on, downward and downward,
holding the silver image close against his
breast, scarcely feeling the boughs which grazed
his cheeks or the flints which wounded his
naked feet.</p>

<p>When he came within sight of the place
where he had left Santina the night before,
he strained his eyes to catch a glimpse of her
through the tangle of leaves and twigs and
fronds. And true enough to her tryst she was
there, waiting impatiently, fretting, wishing the
time away, blaming her own folly in setting all
her hopes of freedom and the future on a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span>
foolish, cowardly churl&mdash;for so she called him
in her angry thought, as she crouched down
under the chestnut scrub and saw the daylight
widen and brighten.</p>

<p>She ran a great risk in hiding there; if any
of her people or their carters saw her, their
suspicions would be aroused and their questions
endless. She would say that she came
for mushrooms; but they would not believe
her. She was too well known for a late riser
and a lazy wench.</p>

<p>Still, she had imperilled everything to keep
her word with him, and she waited for him
seated on the moss, half covered with leaves,
except at such times as her impatient temper
made her cast prudence to the winds and rise
and look out of the thicket upward to the hills.</p>

<p>She had made herself look her best; a yellow
kerchief was tied over her head, her hair shone
like a blackbird's wing, her whole face and form
were full of vivid, rich, and eager animal beauty.
To get away&mdash;oh, only to get away! She
looked up at the wild doves sailing over the
tops of the tall pines and envied them their
flight.</p>

<p>Caris saw that eager, longing look upon her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span>
countenance before he reached her, and he
thought it was caused by love for him.</p>

<p>He held the Gesu to his bosom with both
hands and coursed like lightning down the
steep slope which still divided him from her;
he was unconscious of how jaded, soiled, and
uncomely he looked after his long night's work
and all his ghostly fears; his feet were scratched
and bleeding, his shirt soaked in sweat, his flesh
bespattered with the clay, his hair wet and
matted with moisture; he had no remembrance
of that, he had no suspicion that even in that
moment of agitation, when she believed her
errand done, her will accomplished, she was
saying in her heart as she watched him draw
nigh: 'He has got them, he has got them; but,
Holy Mary! what a clown!&mdash;he has all the mud
of fifty graves upon him!'</p>

<p>He rushed downward to her, and held the
silver image out at arm's-length, and sobbed
and laughed and cried aloud, indifferent who
might hear, his voice trembling with awe and
ecstasy.</p>

<p>'It is the Gesu Himself, the Gesu&mdash;and I
have brought Him to you because now you
will believe&mdash;and my mother must be well with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>
them in heaven or they never had wrought such
a miracle for me&mdash;and such a night as I have
passed, dear God! such things as I have seen
and heard&mdash;but the Child smiles&mdash;the Child
is pleased&mdash;and now you will believe in me,
though I could not find the magic things&mdash;and
I said to myself when she sees the Gesu she
will believe&mdash;and she will be mine&mdash;mine&mdash;mine!
The Lord forgive me, that has been
all my thought, though heaven wrought such
a miracle for me!'</p>

<p>The words poured out of his mouth one over
another like the rush of water let loose through
a narrow channel. He was blind with his own
excess of emotion, his own breathless desire; he
did not see the changes which swept over the
face of Santina in a tumult of wrath, wonder,
fury, eagerness, suspicion, cupidity, as one after
another each emotion went coursing through
her soul and shining in her eyes, making her
beauty distorted and terrible.</p>

<p>Her first impulse was fury at his failure to
bring her what she wanted; the second was to
comprehend in a flash of instantaneous insight
the money value of that to which he only
attached a spiritual merit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>
She snatched the image from him, and in the
morning light she saw the silver of it glisten
through the earth which still in parts clung to
it. It might be better, surer, more quick aid to
her than the uncertain divining tools whereof
she was ignorant of the full employ. Her
rapid mind swept over in a second all the uses
to which it might be put, and comprehended
the superstitious adoration of it which moved
Caris and made him control his passion for herself,
as he stood gazing at it in her arms, his
own hands clasped in prayer, and his whole
frame trembling with the portentous sense of
the mercy of heaven which had been made
manifest to him.</p>

<p>She in a second divined that it had been part
of some buried treasure which he had by accident
disinterred, but she was too keen and wise
to let him see that she did so; it was her part
to humour and to confirm him in his self-deception.</p>

<p>She calmed the angry, gibing words which
rose to her lips, she held back the exultant
covetousness which flashed in her eyes and
betrayed itself in the clutching grasp of her
fingers; she gazed on the Gesu with a worship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span>
half real, half affected, for it was also a holy
image to her, if its sanctity were to her outweighed
and outshone by its monetary worth in
precious metal.</p>

<p>'Tell me how you found this?' she asked,
under her breath, as one almost speechless with
awe before such a manifestation from on high.</p>

<p>She was really in genuine fear. He had been
into precincts which none could enter without
offending immortal and unseen powers. He
had done it at her bidding. Who could be
sure that the offending spirits would not avenge
his sacrilege on her?</p>

<p>But through her fears she kept her hold upon
the image, whilst she asked the question.</p>

<p>Tremblingly he told her how he had passed
the awful hours of the night and failed to find
his mother's tomb, but in its stead found this.</p>

<p>'And I brought it that you should know that
I had been there,' he said in conclusion, 'that
you might know I had been where you willed,
and am no coward; and we will take it back together
and give it to the holy man up yonder&mdash;and
now&mdash;and now&mdash;and now&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>His hands touched her, his breath was upon
her, his timid yet violent passion blazed in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span>
eyes and quivered all over his frame: he had
dared all things for his reward, and he claimed
it. But, quick as lightning, and merciless as
dishonest, she put the holy image between her
and him. The sacred silver froze his burning
lips.</p>

<p>His arms fell to his side as though they were
paralyzed.</p>

<p>'Not while the Gesu is with us,' she murmured
in rebuke. 'Let us not be unworthy&mdash;you
say yourself a miracle was wrought.'</p>

<p>'But&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>He stood before her, checked, daunted,
breathing heavily, like a horse thrown back
on its haunches in full flight.</p>

<p>'Hush!' she said, with a scared look.
'There are people near; I hear them. We
will take the Gesu back to the church, but
that cannot be till dusk. I will keep Him safe
with me. Go, you dear, and clean your skin
and your clothes, lest any seeing you should
suspect what you have done.'</p>

<p>'I will not go,' he muttered; 'you promised&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'I promised, oh fool!' she said, with quick
passion, 'and my word I will keep, but not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span>
while the Gesu is with us. I love you for all
you have braved. I love you for all you have
done. I will be yours and no other's. See! I
swear it on the Holy Child's head!'</p>

<p>And she kissed the silver brow of the
babe.</p>

<p>He was convinced, yet irresolute and impatient.</p>

<p>'Let us go back with it now, then,' he
muttered. 'I did but bring him to show you
in witness of what I had done.'</p>

<p>'No,' she said, with that imperious command
in her voice and her gaze which made the
resolve in him melt like wax beneath a flame.
'You cannot be seen with me in such a state as
you are. I will carry the Christ back to the
church if so be that He rests uneasily in common
arms like ours, and then&mdash;well, I will pass by
your cabin as I come down. Dost complain of
that, my ingrate?'</p>

<p>A flood of warmth and joy and full belief
swept like flame through the whole being of
Caris. Her eyes were suffused, her cheek
blushed, her lips smiled; he believed himself
beloved; he thought himself on the threshold
of ecstasy; the minutes seemed like hours until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span>
he should regain his hut and watch from its
door for her coming.</p>

<p>'You will go now?' he asked eagerly.</p>

<p>'At once,' she answered, holding the Gesu to
her as a woman would hold a sucking child.</p>

<p>Caris closed his eyes, dazed with her beauty
and the wild, sweet thought of how she would
hold to her breast some child of his on some fair
unborn morrow.</p>

<p>'Then go,' he muttered. 'The sooner we
part, the sooner we shall meet. Oh, my
angel!'</p>

<p>She gave him a smile over her shoulder, and
she pushed her way upward through the chestnut
boughs, carrying the Gesu folded to her
bosom.</p>

<p>Watching her thus depart, a sudden and new
terror struck him.</p>

<p>'Wait,' he called to her. 'Will the priest
be angered that I disturbed the graves, think
you?'</p>

<p>'Nay, nay, not when he sees that you give
him the image,' she called backward in answer.</p>

<p>Then she disappeared in the green haze of
foliage, and Caris struck onward in the opposite
direction, to take the way which led to his cabin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span>
on Genistrello. Her words had awakened him
to a consciousness of his bruised, befouled, and
tattered state.</p>

<p>He wished to avoid meeting anyone who
might question him as to his condition.</p>

<p>He got as quickly as he could by solitary
paths to his home, and was met with rapture by
his dog. He entered the house, and drank
thirstily; he could not eat; he washed in the
tank at the back of the hut, and clothed himself
in the best that he had: what he wore on holy
and on festal days.</p>

<p>Then he set his house-door wide open to the
gay morning light which, green and gleeful,
poured through the trunks of the chestnuts and
pines; and he sat down on his threshold with
the dog at his feet, and waited.</p>

<p>It would be a whole working-day lost, but
what of that? A lover may well lose a day's
pay for love's crown of joy.</p>

<p>Hour after hour passed by, and his eyes
strained and ached with looking into the green
light of the woods. But Santina came not.</p>

<p>The forenoon, and noontide and afternoon
went by; and still no living thing came up to
his solitary house. The whole day wore away,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span>
and he saw no one, heard nothing, had no
visitant except the black stoat which flitted
across the path, and the grey thrushes which
flew by on their autumn flights towards lower
ground.</p>

<p>The long, fragrant, empty day crept slowly
by, and at last ended. She had not come.</p>

<p>He was still fasting. He drank thirstily, but
he could not eat, though he fed the dog.</p>

<p>He was in a state of nervous excitation almost
delirious. The trees and the hills and the sky
seemed to whirl around him. He dared not
leave the hut, lest she should come thither in
his absence. He stared till he was sightless
along the green path which led down to the four
roads. Now and then, stupidly, uselessly, he
shouted aloud; and the mountains echoed his
solitary voice.</p>

<p>The dog knew that something was wrong
with his master, and was pained and afraid.</p>

<p>The evening fell. The night wore away.
He put a little lamp in his doorway, thinking
she might come, through shyness, after dark;
but no one came. Of her there was no sign, or
from her any word.</p>

<p>When the day came he was still dressed and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a></span>
sleepless, seated before his door; the flame of
the little lamp burnt on, garish and yellow in
the sunshine.</p>

<p>The sun mounted to the zenith; it was
again noon. He went indoors, and took a
great knife which he was accustomed to carry
with him to Maremma. He put it in his belt
inside his breeches, so that it was invisible.</p>

<p>Then he called the dog to him, kissed him on
the forehead, gave him bread, and motioned to
him to guard the house; then he took his way
once more down the hillside to Massaio's
house.</p>

<p>If she had fooled him yet again, she would
not live to do it thrice. His throat was dry as
sand; his eyes were bloodshot; his look was
strange.</p>

<p>The dog howled and moaned as he passed out
of sight.</p>

<p>He went onward under the boughs tinged
with their autumnal fires, until he came to the
place where the house and sheds and walls of
the wood merchant's homestead stood. He
walked straight in through the open gates, and
then stood still.</p>

<p>He saw that there was some unusual stir and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span>
trouble in the place: no one was at work, the
children were gaping and gabbling, the housewife
was standing doing nothing, her hands at
her sides; Massaio himself was seated drumming
absently on the table.</p>

<p>'Where is Santina?' asked Caris.</p>

<p>They all spoke in answer, 'Santina is a jade'&mdash;Massaio's
voice louder and rougher than the
rest.</p>

<p>'She has gone out of the town and away,
none knows where; and she has left a letter behind
her saying that none need try to follow,
for she is gone to a fine new world, where she
will want none of us about her; and my brother
says it is all my fault, giving her liberty out on
the hills. And the marvel is where she got the
money, for we and they kept her so close&mdash;not
a stiver&mdash;not a penny&mdash;and it seems she took
the train that goes over the mountains ever so
far, and paid a power of gold at the station
wicket.'</p>

<p>The voice of Caris crossed his in a loud,
bitter cry. 'She sold the Gesu! As God lives&mdash;she
sold the Gesu!'</p>

<p>Then the blood rushed from his nostrils and
his mouth, and he fell face downwards.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span></p>

<h3>VII</h3>

<p>A few days later he was arrested for having
violated and robbed the tombs in the burial-grounds
of St. Fulvo. The pickaxe and the
spade had been found with his name burned on
the wood of them; he was sentenced to three
years at the galleys for sacrilege and theft.</p>

<p>When the three years were ended he was an
old, gray, bowed man, though only twenty-nine
years of age; he returned to his cabin, and the
dog, who had been cared for by the charcoal-burners,
knew him from afar off, and flew down
the hill-path to meet him.</p>

<p>'The wench who ruined you,' said the charcoal-burners
around their fire that night, 'they
do say she is a fine singer and a rich madam
somewhere in foreign parts. She sold the Gesu&mdash;ay,
she sold the Gesu to a silversmith down in
the town. That gave her the money to start
with, and the rest her face and her voice have
done for her.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span>
'Who has the Gesu?' asked Caris, hiding
his eyes on the head of the dog.</p>

<p>'Oh, the Gesu, they say, was put in the
smelting-pot,' said the charcoal-burner.</p>

<p>Caris felt for the knife which was inside his
belt. It had been given back to him with his
clothes when he had been set free at the end of
his sentence.</p>

<p>'One could find her,' he thought, with a
thrill of savage longing. Then he looked down
at the dog and across at the green aisles of the
pines and chestnuts.</p>

<p>'Let the jade be,' said the forest-man to him.
'You are home again, and 'twas not you who
bartered the Christ.'</p>

<p>Caris fondled the haft of the great knife
under his waistband.</p>

<p>'She stole the Gesu and sold Him,' he said,
in a hushed voice. 'One day I will find her,
and I will strike her: once for myself and twice
for Him.'</p>

<h2><a name="A_LEMON-TREE" id="A_LEMON-TREE">A LEMON-TREE</a></h2>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>It was a small lemon-tree, not more than forty
inches high, growing in its red earthen vase as
all lemons are obliged to be grown further
north than Rome. There were many thousands
and tens of thousands of other such trees in the
land; but this one, although so little, was a
source of joy and pride to its owner. He had
grown it himself from a slender slip cast away
on a heap of rubbish, and he had saved his
pence up with effort and self-denial to purchase,
second-hand, the big pot of ruddy clay in
which it grew, now that it had reached its first
fruit-bearing prime. It had borne as its first
crop seven big, fragrant lemons, hanging from
its boughs amidst leaves which were as fresh and
green as a meadow in May. He had watched
its first buds creep out of the slender twigs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">306</a></span>
and swell and swell gradually into sharp-pointed
little cones, which in their turn became pale
yellow fruit, 'fit for a princess,' as he said,
patting their primrose-coloured rind. They
seemed so many separate miracles to him,
coming as by some magic out of the little
starry white flowers on the glossy twigs.</p>

<p>He was a poor, ignorant man, by name Dario
Baldassino, known as Fringuello (or the
Chaffinch) to his neighbourhood and fellow
workmen. He lived on the south side of the
ferry of Royezano, and dug and carted the
river-sand; a rude labour and a thankless,
taking the sinew and spirit out of a man, and
putting little in return into his pocket. The
nave or ferry is a place to please an artist. All
the land around on this south side is orchard&mdash;great
pear-trees and cherry-trees linked together
by low-growing vines, and in the spring months
making a sea of blossom stretching to the
river's edge. The watermills, which were there
centuries ago, stand yellow and old, and cluster
like beavers' dams upon the water. The noise
of the weir is loud, but the song of the nightingale
can be heard above it. Looking along
westward down the widening, curving stream,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">307</a></span>
above the fruit-trees planted thick as woods,
there arise, two miles off, the domes and spires
of the city of Florence, backed by the hills,
which here take an Alpine look upon them
when the sun sets beyond the rounded summits
of the more distant Carrara range; and the
spurs of the Apennines grow deeply blue with
that intense transparent colour which is never
seen in northern lands. To the north also lie
the mountains, and on the east; and late into
May the snow lingers where the day breaks
above Vallombrosa and Casentino. All the
vale is orchard, broken now and then by some
great stone-pine, some walnut or chestnut tree,
some church spire with its statue of its saint,
some low, red-brown roofs, some grey old
granary with open-timbered lofts. It is a serene
and sylvan scene&mdash;at sunset and at sunrise
grand&mdash;and the distant city rises on its throne
of verdure, seeming transfigured as Dante,
exiled, may have seen it in his dreams.</p>

<p>Of all this beauty outspread before his sight
Fringuello saw little; his eyes were always set
on the sand and shingle into which he drove his
heart-shaped spade&mdash;all which is the pageant of
the painter, the paradise of the poet, but is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">308</a></span>
nothing to the toiler of the soil. The sweat of
his fatigue drops down before his eyes, and shuts
out from him the scenes amidst which he dwells.
For him the weir has no song, the orchard no
poem, the mountains no counsel, and the vales
no charm. He does but see the cart-rucks in
the sand, the house-fly in the sunlight, the coins
hard-earned in his horny palm, the straw which
covers the coveted wine-flask, or the glass which
holds the hot and acid flavours of less natural
drinks. Now and then Giotto looks up from
his sheepfold, and Robert Burns from his furrow,
but it is only once in a century. This poor
labourer, Fringuello, lived in two little rooms in
a poor house which looked on the weir and the
water-mills. He had never been able to have a
house of his own, and even the small charge of
the rooms was more than he could easily pay,
miserable though they were. His employment
was intermittent, and in winter, when the river
was spread wide over its bed, covering the sand
and shingle, it ceased entirely. Some odd jobs he
got elsewhere, but nothing certain. He had no
knowledge of any other work than the digging
and carrying which had been his lot. But he
was always merry, with the mirth which had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">309</a></span>
gained him his nickname, and in his light-hearted
poverty had done what the poorest always do&mdash;he
had married at twenty a girl as poor as himself.
She was called Lizina, the familiar corruption
of Luisa, and was the daughter of a
cobbler of the adjacent village of Ripoli.</p>

<p>It was an imprudent union and a foolish one,
but it was happier than many which fulfil every
condition of prudence and thrift. Lizina was a
blithe, buoyant, active, and laborious creature,
and whilst she lived he never had a hole in his
hempen shirt, or went without a tablespoonful
of oil to his beans and bread. They were as
merry and happy as if they had really been a
pair of chaffinches in a nest in one of the pear-trees.
But of joy the gods are envious, whether
it go to roost in garret or palace, and in a few
brief years Lizina died of fever and left him all
alone with one little girl, as like herself as the
bud is like the flower.</p>

<p>For months he never sang as he worked, and
his ruddy face was pale, and he had long fits of
weeping when he lay on his lonely bed, and
stared up at the starry skies which were visible
through the square, unshuttered window. Lizina
was in the ground, in a nameless grave, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">310</a></span>
two crossed sticks set above it, and the river
rolled over the weir, and the wide wheel turned,
and the orchards blossomed, and the people
laughed on the yellow sand, and no one cared
that a little merry, glad, tender, harmless life
was done for and over, stamped down into the
clay like a crushed butterfly, a broken branch, a
rotten fruit, or a dead grasshopper. Nobody
cared; and after a time he, too, ceased to care,
and began to hum and whistle and carol once
more as he worked, and laughed once more at
his comrades' jokes as they dug up the heavy
sand. In the lives of the poor there is little
leisure for sorrow, and toil passes over them
like an iron roller over the inequalities of a
road, forcing them down into dull indifference,
as the roller forces into level nothingness alike
the jagged flint and the sprouting grass.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Lizina, as she was called after
her mother, grew up apace like the little
lemon-tree which had been planted at her
birth, a lovely child like a Correggio cherub,
thriving on her dry bed and herb-soup as
the lemon plant thrived on the dry earth and
uncongenial atmosphere of the attic under the
roofs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">311</a></span>
Fringuello did his best by both of them,
making up to them by tenderness and gentleness
what he was forced to refuse to both of
material comfort. Both the child and the tree
went hungry often, suffered from cold and frost
in the sharp, short winters, and languished in
the scorching days, when foul odours rose from
the naked bed of the shrunken river, and white
clouds of little moths hovered over the cracked
sand, and the leaves of the orchards grew yellow
and wrinkled, and curled up, and dropped in
the heat before their time.</p>

<p>All that he could not help; he could not help
it more than he could help the shrinking of the
river in drought, and the coming of blight to
the orchards. Though it went to his soul like
a knife-thrust when he saw the child pale and
thin, and the lemon-tree sickly and shrunk, he
could do nothing. But he murmured always,
'Patience, courage,' as he coaxed the child to
eat a morsel of crust, and consoled the tree with
a spray of spring-water, and he got them both
safely through several burning summers and icy
winters, and when they were both sixteen years
old the tree was strong and buxom, with glossy
foliage and fine fruit, and the child was healthy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">312</a></span>
and handsome, with shining eyes and laughing
mouth.</p>

<p>He had worked as hard as any mule for
them both, and though a young man in years,
he looked an old man from excess of toil,
though his heart was light and his smile was
like sunshine.</p>

<p>When he got up in the dark to go to his
work, and drew his leathern belt about his lean
ribs, he always looked at the pale light of dawn
as it touched the green leaves of the tree and the
closed eyes of the child, and then he muttered
an Ave, content and thankful at heart. Many
would have thought the hardness of his lot
excuse enough for suicide; he never knew what
it was not to feel tired, he never knew what it
was to have a coin in his pocket for pleasure.
His bones ached, and the gnawing of rheumatism
was in his nerves, from the many hours
spent knee-deep in water or damp sand, and
always at the pit of his stomach was that other
still worse gnawing of perpetual insufficiency of
food. But he was content and grateful to his
fate, as the birds are, though they hunger and
thirst, and every man's hand is against them.</p>

<p>The child and the tree were indissolubly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">313</a></span>
united in his mind and memory. They had
grown up together, and seemed part and parcel
of each other. Imagination scarcely exists in the
brains of the poor; they do not know what it
is. The perpetual grind of daily want leaves
no space for or possibility of impersonal fancy
in it; but, in a vague kind of superstitious way,
he associated the well-being of the one with the
welfare of the other. If the tree sickened and
drooped for a day, he always looked nervously
at Lizina to see if she ailed anything also. If
the little girl coughed or grew hot with fever,
he always watched anxiously the leaves of the
lemon. It was a talisman and fetish to him;
and when he came up from the river at evening
when his work was done, he looked upward
always to see the green boughs of the tree at
the square little window of his garret under
the deep eaves, and above an archway of old
brown-red brick.</p>

<p>If it had been missing at the window, he
would have told himself that Lizina was dead.
There was no likelihood that it would ever be
missing there. Lemon-trees live long, and this
one would, he knew, most likely outlive himself
if he kept it from worm and fly, and rot and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">314</a></span>
mildew. Nevertheless, he always glanced upward
to make sure that it was there when he
toiled up the strip of road which led to his
home when his work in the sand was done.
Lizina herself did not wait at the window.
She always came jumping and dancing down
the path, her auburn curls flying, and her big
brown eyes sparkling; barefooted, ill-clad,
scarcely fed, but happy and healthy, singing at
the top of her voice as her father had always
done in his youth.</p>

<p>When they reached their fifteenth birthday,
neither she nor the lemon-tree had ever ailed
anything worse than a passing chill from a
frosty week, or a transient sickness from a
sultry drought.</p>

<p>The lemon-tree had given her the few little
gifts she had ever received. The pence brought
in by its fruit were always laid out for her:
cake at Christmas, sugar-egg at Easter, a white
ribbon for her first Communion, a pair of shoes
to wear on high feasts and holy days&mdash;these
little joys, few and far between, had all come to
her from the copper pieces gained by the pale,
wrinkled, fragrant fruit sold at five centimes
each in the village or the town. '<i>Soldi della<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">315</a></span>
Lizinanina</i>,' said her father whenever he put
any so gained in his trousers pocket.</p>

<p>Well as he loved his pipe, and thankful as he
was when he could get a drink of watered wine,
he never touched a halfpenny of the lemon
money to buy a pinch of tobacco or a glass of
<i>mezzo-vino</i>. It was all saved up carefully for
his little girl's small wants. Sometimes in hard
seasons it had even to go in bread for her, but
of that bread he would never himself take a
mouthful. Moreover, the pence were few, for
the lemons were not many.</p>

<p>Lizina remained quite a child, though she
grew fast, and her little round breasts swelled
up high and firm where the rough hempen shift
cut across them. Young as she was, the eyes of
an admirer had fallen upon her, and young
Cecco, the son of Lillo, the <i>contadino</i> where the
big pine stood (a pine three hundred years old
if one), had said to her father and to her that
when he had served out his time in the army
he should say something serious about it; but
Fringuello had answered him ungraciously that
he could never give her bridal clothes or bridal
linen, so that she would needs die a maid, and
his own people had told him roughly that when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">316</a></span>
he should have served his time he would be in
a different mind. But Cecco, nevertheless,
thought nothing would please him ever so well
as this ragged, pretty child with her blowing
cloud of short, crisp bright curls, and he said to
her one evening as she sat on the wall by the
ferry, 'If you will be patient, my Lizinanina, I
will be true;' and Lizina, too young to be
serious, but amused and triumphant, laughed
gaily and saucily, and replied to him: 'I will
make no promises, Cecco. You will come back
with a shorn pate and soft hands and tender
soles to your feet.'</p>

<p>For the soldier seems but a poor creature to
the children of the soil, and is, indeed, of but
little use when the barracks vomit him out of
their jaws and send him back to his home, a
poor, indifferent trooper, but also a spoiled
peasant; having learned to write indeed, but
having forgotten how to handle a spade, drive a
plough, or prune a grape-vine, and to whose
feet, once hard and firm as leather, the once
familiar earth with its stones and thorns and
sticks seems rough and sharp and painful, after
having marched in ill-fitting boots for three
years along smooth roads and paven streets.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">317</a></span>
To the city lad and lass the conscript may
seem somebody very fine; but to the country
ones he seems but a mere popinjay, only useful
to waste powder. Lizina, although only a river
labourer's daughter, was country born and bred,
and had the prejudices and preferences of the
country, and had run about under the orchard
boughs and down the vineyards of the countryside
till she thought as a peasant and spoke as
one.</p>

<p>Cecco was mortified, but he shared her views
of the life to which he was about to go. He
was useful now to tame a steer, to milk a heifer,
to fell a tree, to mow a meadow, to reap a field,
to get up in the dark and drive the colt into
the city with a load of straw and bring back a
load of manure. But in the barracks he would
be nothing&mdash;worse than nothing; a poor numb-skull,
strapped up in stiff clothes with a pack
on his back, and a musket, which he must fire
at nothing, on his shoulder.</p>

<p>'Wait for me, Lizina,' he said sadly. 'The
time will soon pass, and I will come back and
marry you, despite them all.'</p>

<p>'Pooh! I shall have married a man with a
mint of money by the time they let you come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">318</a></span>
back,' said the unkind child, saucily tossing the
curls out of her eyes; but through her long
lashes her glance rested a moment softly on the
ruddy face of Cecco, which had looked down
on her so often through the boughs and twigs
of the cherry or pear trees of his father's farm,
as he threw down fruit into her outstretched
and eager little hands where she stood in the
grass of the orchard.</p>

<p>She said nothing more tender then, being
coy and wayward and hard to please, as became
her incipient womanhood; but before she went
to bed that night she came close to her father's
side and put her hand on his.</p>

<p>'Cecco says he will come back and marry
me, <i>babbo</i>,' she said, with a child's directness.
Her father stroked her curls.</p>

<p>'That is a joke, dear; his people would
never let him marry a little penniless chit like
you.'</p>

<p>Lizina shook her head sagely with a little
proud smile.</p>

<p>'He will not mind his people. He will do
it&mdash;if I wish&mdash;when he comes back.'</p>

<p>Her father looked at her in amazement; in
his eyes she was a little child still.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">319</a></span>
'Why, baby, you speak like a woman!' he
said stupidly. 'I am glad this lad goes away,
as he puts such nonsense into your head.'</p>

<p>'But if we both wish, you would not mind,
<i>babbo</i>?' she asked, persistent and serious.</p>

<p>'The angels save us! She speaks like a
grown woman!' cried her father. 'My poor
little dear,' he thought sadly, 'you will never
be able to wed anyone. We are poor! so
poor! I can never give you even a set of
shifts. Who could go to a house so naked&mdash;in
rags, as one may say? My poor little angel,
you must live a maid or go to a husband as
beggared as I.'</p>

<p>He wished to say all this, but the words
choked him in his throat. It seemed so cruel
to set before the child the harsh, mean demands
of life, the merciless rules and habits of that
narrow world of theirs, which was bounded by
the river and the sand on one side, and the
cornfields and orchards on the other.</p>

<p>'Let be, let be,' he said to himself. 'She is
but a child, and the youth is going away for
years; if it please her to think of this thing, it
can hurt no one. He will forget, and she will
forget.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">320</a></span>
So he patted her pretty brown cheek, and
drew her closer and kissed her.</p>

<p>'You are but a baby, my treasure,' he said
softly. 'Put these grave thoughts out of your
head. Many moons will wax and wane before
Cecco will be free again to come to his old
home. The future can take care of itself. I
will say neither yea nor nay. We will see
what the years will bring forth.'</p>

<p>'But you would not mind?' she murmured
coaxingly.</p>

<p>The tears started to his eyes.</p>

<p>'Ah! God knows, dear, how sweet it would
be to me!'</p>

<p>He thought of his little girl safe and happy
for her lifetime in that pleasant and plentiful
household under the red-brown roofs where the
big pine grew amongst the pear and cherry
trees. The vision of it was beautiful and impossible.
It hurt him to look on it, as the sun
dazzles the eyes at noon.</p>

<p>'But put it out of your head&mdash;out of your
head, little one!' he said. 'Even if the boy
should keep of the same mind, never would
Lillo consent.'</p>

<p>'Cecco will keep in the same mind,' said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">321</a></span>
Lizina, with the serene undoubting certainty of
childhood, and she broke off a little twig of the
lemon-tree, with a bud upon it and three
leaves, and gave it to Cecco that evening in the
dusk as they sat again upon the river-wall. It
was all she had to give, except her little waking
heart.</p>

<p>The next day he went away along the dusty
high-road in his father's cart to begin his new
life. He sobbed as if his heart would break,
and fastened in his shirt was the lemon shoot.</p>

<p>'To break off a bud! Oh, Lizina!' cried
her father, in reproof and reproach. 'A bud
means a fruit, and a fruit means a halfpenny,
perhaps a penny.'</p>

<p>'It is only one,' said the child; 'and I have
nothing else.'</p>

<p>Lizina did not speak of him, nor did she
seem to fret in any way. Her blithe voice rang
in clear carol over the green river water, as she
sat on the wall whilst her father worked below,
and she ate her dry bread with healthy and
happy appetite.</p>

<p>'She is only a baby. She has forgotten the
boy already,' thought her father, half disappointed,
half relieved, whilst he broke up the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">322</a></span>
earth about the roots of the lemon-tree, and
counted the little pointed fruits coming out on
it, green as malachite, and promising a fair crop.</p>

<p>No letters could arrive to stimulate her
memory, for Cecco could scarcely scrawl his
name, and Lizina could not read her A B C.
Absence to the poor is a complete rupture, an
absolute blank, over which the intelligence can
throw no bridge.</p>

<p>Fringuello worked early and late, worked like
a willing mule, and lost no chance of doing anything,
however hard, which could bring in a
centime; and he was so tired when night fell
that he could do little except swallow his bread-soup
and fling himself down on his bed of dry
leaves thrust into an old sack. So that as long
as Lizina's voice was heard in song, and her
little bare feet ran busily to and fro, he noticed
nothing else, and was content, believing all was
well with her.</p>

<p>The winter which followed on Cecco's
departure to his military service was of unusual
rigour for the vale of Arno; the waters were
stormy and dark, and the fields were frozen and
brown, and snow lay on the long lines of the
mountains from their summit to their base.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">323</a></span>
But the lemon-tree flourished before its narrow
window, and Lizina was well and gay in the
cold little brick-floored, plaster-walled, unceiled
garret; and her father asked nothing more of
Fate, and went out to his work in the bitter
coldness and darkness of the morning dawns
with an empty stomach but a warm heart,
leaving her sleeping, easily and dreamlessly,
curled up like a little dormouse in her corner of
the room.</p>

<p>The winter passed and the spring came,
making all the orchard lands once more become
seas of white flowers, and setting the chaffinches
and linnets and nightingales to work at their
nests amongst the lovely labyrinth of bursting
blossom; and one sunlit afternoon, towards the
close of April, the village priest, coming along
the road by the river, saw Fringuello, who was
backing his sand-cart into the bed of the now
shallow stream, and beckoned to him. The
priest had an open letter in his hand, and his
plump, smooth olive face was sad.</p>

<p>'Dario,' he said gravely, 'I have some terrible
news in this paper. Lillo's son, Cecco, is dead.
I have to go and tell the family. The authorities
have written to me.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">324</a></span>
He stopped suddenly, surprised by the effect
which his news had on his hearer.</p>

<p>'Saints protect us, how you look!' he cried.
'One would think you were the lad's father!'</p>

<p>'Is it sure? Is it true?' stammered
Fringuello.</p>

<p>'Ay, ay, it is true and sure enough. The
authorities write to me,' answered the vicar,
with some pride. 'Poor lad! Poor, good,
pretty lad! They sent him to the Marenna
marshes, and the ague and fever got on him,
and he died in the fort a week ago. And only
to think that this time last year he was bringing
me armfuls of blooming cherry boughs for the
altar at Easter-day! And now dead and buried.
Good lack! Far away from all his friends, poor
lad! The decrees of heaven are inscrutable, but
it is of course for the best.'</p>

<p>He crossed himself and went on his way.</p>

<p>Fringuello doffed his cap mechanically, and
crossed himself also, and rested against the shaft
of his cart with his face leaning on his hands.
His hope was struck down into nothingness;
the future had no longer a smile. Though he
had told himself, and them, that children were
fickle and unstable, and that nothing was less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">325</a></span>
likely than that the lad would come back in the
same mind, he had nevertheless clung to and
cherished the idea of such a fate for his little
daughter with a tenacity of which he had been
unconscious until his air castle was scattered to
the winds by the words of the priest. The boy
was dead; and never would Lizina go to dwell
in peace and plenty at the old farmhouse by the
great pine.</p>

<p>'It was too good to be. Patience!' he said
to himself, with a groan, as he lifted his head
and bade the mule between the shafts move
onward. His job had to be done; his load had
to be carried; he had no leisure to sit down
alone with his regret.</p>

<p>'And it is worse for Lillo than it is for me,'
he said to himself, with an unselfish thought for
the lad's father.</p>

<p>He looked up at the little window of his own
attic which he could see afar off; the lemon-tree
was visible, and beside it the little brown
head of Lizina as she sat sewing.</p>

<p>'Perhaps she will not care; I hope she will
not care,' he thought.</p>

<p>He longed to go and tell her himself lest she
should hear it from some gossip, but he could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">326</a></span>
not leave his work. Yet, he could not bear the
child to learn it first from the careless chattering
of neighbouring gossips.</p>

<p>When he had discharged the load he carried,
he fastened the mule to a post by the water-side,
and said to a fellow-carter, 'Will you
watch him a moment whilst I run home?' and
on the man's assenting he flew with lightning
speed along the road and up the staircase of his
house.</p>

<p>Lizina dropped her sewing in amazement as
he burst into the room and stood on the
threshold with a look which frightened her.</p>

<p>She ran to him quickly.</p>

<p>'<i>Babbo!</i> <i>Babbo!</i> What is the matter?'
she cried to him. Then, before he could
answer, she said timidly, under her breath, 'Is
anything wrong&mdash;with Cecco?'</p>

<p>Then Fringuello turned his head away and
wept aloud.</p>

<p>He had hoped the child had forgotten. He
knew now that she had remembered only too
well. All through the year which had gone by
since the departure of the youth she had been
as happy as a field-mouse undisturbed in the
wheat. The grain was not ripe yet for her,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">327</a></span>
but she was sure that it would be, and that her
harvest would be plenteous. She had always
been sure, quite sure, that Cecco would come
back; and now, in an instant, she understood
that he was dead.</p>

<p>Lizina said little then or at any time; but
the little gay life of her changed, grew dull,
seemed to shrink into itself and wither up as a
flower will when a worm is at its root. She had
been so sure that Cecco would return!</p>

<p>'She is so young; soon it will not matter to
her,' her father told himself.</p>

<p>But the months went by and the seasons, and
she did not recover her bloom, her mirth, her
elasticity; her small face was always grave and
pale. She went about her work in the same
way, and was docile, and industrious, and uncomplaining,
but something was wrong with
her. She did not laugh, she did not sing; she
seldom even spoke unless she was spoken to
first. He tried to persuade himself that there
was no change in her, but he knew that he tried
to feed himself on falsehood. He might as well
have thought his lemon-tree unaltered if he had
found it withered up by fire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">328</a></span></p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>Once Lizina said to her father, 'Could one
walk there?'</p>

<p>'Where, dear? Where?'</p>

<p>'Where they have put Cecco,' she answered,
knowing nothing of distances or measurements
or the meaning of travel or change of place.</p>

<p>She had never been farther than across the
ferry to the other bank of the river.</p>

<p>Her father threw up his hands in despair.</p>

<p>'Lord! my treasure! why it is miles and
miles and miles away! I don't know rightly
even where&mdash;some place where the sun goes
down.'</p>

<p>And her idea of walking thither seemed to
him so stupefying, so amazing, so incredible,
that he stared at her timorously, afraid that
her brain was going wrong. He had never
gone anywhere in all his life.</p>

<p>'Oh, my pretty, what should we do, you and
I, in a strange place?' moaned Fringuello,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">329</a></span>
weeping with fear at the thought of change
and with grief at the worn, fevered face lifted
up to his. 'Never have I stirred from here
since I was born, nor you. To move to and
fro&mdash;that is for well-to-do folks, not for us;
and when you are so ill, my poor little one,
that you can scarcely stand on your feet&mdash;if
you were to die on the way&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'I shall not die on the way,' said the child
firmly.</p>

<p>'But I know nought of the way,' he cried
wildly and piteously. 'Never was I in one of
those strings of fire-led waggons, nor was ever
any one of my people that ever I heard tell of.
How should we ever get there, you and I? I
know not even rightly what place it is.'</p>

<p>'I know,' said Lizina; and she took a
crumpled scrap of paper out of the breast of
her worn and frayed cotton frock. It bore the
name of the seashore town where Cecco had
died. She had got the priest to write it down
for her. 'If we show this all along as we go
people will put us right until we reach the
place,' she said, with that quiet persistency
which was so new in her. 'Ask how one can
get there,' she persisted, and wound her arm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">330</a></span>
about his throat, and laid her cheek against his
in her old caressing way.</p>

<p>'You are mad, little one&mdash;quite mad!' said
Fringuello, aghast and affrighted; and he
begged the priest to come and see her.</p>

<p>The priest did come, but said sorrowfully to
him:</p>

<p>'Were I you, I would take her down to one
of the hospitals in the town; she is ill.'</p>

<p>He did so. He had been in the town but a
few times in his whole life; she never. It was
now wintry weather; the roads were wet, the
winds were cold; the child coughed as she
walked and shivered in her scanty and too thin
clothes. The wise men at the hospital looked
at her hastily among a crowd of sick people,
and said some unintelligible words, and scrawled
something on a piece of paper&mdash;a medicine, as
it proved&mdash;which cost to buy more than a day
of a sand carter's wage.</p>

<p>'Has she really any illness?' he asked, with
wild, imploring eyes, of the chemist who made
up the medicine.</p>

<p>'Oh no&mdash;a mere nothing,' said the man in
answer; but thought as he spoke: 'The doctors
might spare the poor devil's money. When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">331</a></span>
the blood is all water like that there is nothing
to be done; the life just goes out like a wind-blown
candle.' 'Get her good wine; butcher's
meat; plenty of nourishing food,' he added,
reflecting that while there is youth there is
hope.</p>

<p>The father groaned aloud, as he laid down
the coins which were the price of the medicine.
Wine! Meat! Nourishment! They might
as well have bidden him feed her on powdered
pearls and melted gold. They got home that
day footsore and wet through; he made a little
fire of boughs and vine-branches, and, for the
first time ever since it had been planted, he
forgot to look at the lemon-tree.</p>

<p>'You are not ill, my Lizinanina?' he
said eagerly. 'The chemist told me it was
nothing.'</p>

<p>'Oh no, it is nothing,' said the child; and
she spoke cheerfully and tried to control the
cough which shook her from head to foot.</p>

<p>Tears rolled down her father's cheeks and
fell on to the smouldering heather, which he set
all right. Wine! Meat! Nourishment! The
three vain words rang through his head all
night. They might as well have bade him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">332</a></span>
set her on a golden throne and call the stars
down from their spheres to circle round her.</p>

<p>'My poor little baby!' he thought; 'never
did she have a finger ache, or a winter chill,
or an hour's discomfort, or a moment's pain
in mind or body until now!'</p>

<p>The child wasted and sickened visibly day
by day. Her father looked to see the lemon-tree
waste and sicken also; but it flourished
still, a green, fresh, happy thing, though growing
in a place so poor. A superstitious, silly
notion took possession of him, begotten by his
nervous terrors for his child, and by the mental
weakness which came of physical want. He
fancied the lemon-tree hurt the child, and
drew nourishment and strength away from her.
Perhaps in the night, in some mysterious way&mdash;who
knew how? He grew stupid and
feverish, working so hardly all day on hardly
more than a crust, and not sleeping at night
through his fears for Lizina. Everything
seemed to him cruel, wicked, unintelligible.
Why had the State taken away the boy who
was so contented and useful where he was
born? Why had the strange, confined, wearisome
life amongst the marshlands killed him?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">333</a></span>
Why was he himself without even means to
get decent food? Why, after working hard
all these years, could he have no peace? Must
he even lose the one little creature he had?
The harshness and injustice of it all disturbed
his brain and weighed upon his soul. He sank
into a sullen silence; he was in the mood
when good men turn bad, and burn, pillage,
slay&mdash;not because they are wicked or unkind
by nature, but because they are mad from
misery.</p>

<p>But she was so young, and had been always
so strong, he thought; this would pass before
long, and she would be herself again&mdash;brisk,
brown, agile, mirthful, singing at the top of
her voice as she ran through the lines of the
cherry-trees. He denied himself everything
to get her food, and left himself scarce enough
to keep the spark of life in him. He sold
even his one better suit of clothes and his one
pair of boots; but she had no appetite, and
perceiving his sacrifice, took it so piteously to
heart that it made her worse.</p>

<p>The neighbours were good-natured and
brought now an egg, now a fruit, now a loaf
for Lizina; but they could not bring her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">334</a></span>
appetite, and were offended and chilled by her
lassitude, her apparent ignorance of their good
intentions, and her indifference to their gifts.</p>

<p>Some suggested this nostrum, others that;
some urged religious pilgrimages, and some
herbs, and some charms, and some spoke of a
wise woman, who, if you crossed her hand
with silver, could relieve you of any evil if
she would. But amidst the multitude of counsellors,
Lizina only grew thinner and thinner,
paler and paler, all her youth seeming slowly
to wane and die out of her.</p>

<p>Her little sick heart was set obstinately on
what her father had told her was impossible.</p>

<p>None of Cecco's own people thought of
going to the place where he died. He was
dead, and there was an end to it; even his
mother, although she wept for him, did not
dream of throwing away good money in a silly
and useless journey to the place where he had
been put in the ground.</p>

<p>Only the little girl, who had laughed at him
and flouted him as they sat on the wall by the
river, did think of it constantly, tenaciously,
silently. It seemed to her horrible to leave
him all alone in some unfamiliar, desolate place,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">335</a></span>
where no step was ever heard of any whom
he had ever known. She said nothing of it,
for she saw that even her father did not understand;
but she brooded over the thought of
it constantly, turning to and fro in her mind
the little she had ever known or heard of the
manner and means by which people transported
themselves from place to place. There were
many, of course, in the village who could have
told her how others travelled, but she was too
shy to speak of the matter even to the old
man of the ferry, in whose boat, when it was
moored to a <i>poula</i> driven in the sand, she had
spent many an hour of playtime. She had
always been a babbling, communicative, merry
child, chattering like a starling or a swift, until
now. Now she spoke rarely, and never of the
thing of which her heart was full.</p>

<p>One day her father looked from her pinched,
wan face to the bright green leaves of the
flourishing lemon-tree, and muttered an oath.</p>

<p>'Day and night, for as many years as you are
old, I have taken care of that tree, and sheltered
it and fed it; and now it alone is fair to see and
strong, whilst you&mdash;verily, oh verily, Lizina, I
could find it in my heart to take a billhook and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">336</a></span>
hew it down for its cruelty in being glad and
full of vigour, whilst you pinch and fade, day by
day, before my sight!'</p>

<p>Lizina shook her head, and looked at the
tree which had been the companion of her
fifteen years of life.</p>

<p>'It's a good tree, <i>babbo</i>!' she said gently.
'Think how much it has given us; how many
things you bought me with the lemon money!
Oh! it is very good; do not ever say a word
against it; but&mdash;but&mdash;if you are in anger with
it, there is a thing which you might do. You
have always kept the money which it brought
for me?'</p>

<p>'Surely, dear. I have always thought it
yours,' he answered, wondering where her
thoughts were tending.</p>

<p>'Then&mdash;then,' said Lizina timidly, 'if it be
as mine really, and you see it no more with
pleasure in its place there, will you sell it, and
with the price of it take me to where Cecco
lies?'</p>

<p>Her eyes were intensely wistful; her cheeks
grew momentarily red in her eagerness; she put
both hands to her chest and tried to stop the
cough which began to choke her words. Her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">337</a></span>
father stared, incredulous that he could hear
aright.</p>

<p>'Sell the tree?' he asked stupidly.</p>

<p>Not in his uttermost needs had the idea of
selling it come to him. He held it in a
superstitious awe.</p>

<p>'Since you say it is mine,' said the child.
'It would sell well. It is strong and beautiful
and bears good fruit. You could take me down
where the sun sets and the sea is&mdash;where Cecco
lies in the grass.'</p>

<p>'Good Lord!' said Fringuello, with a moan.</p>

<p>It seemed to him that the sorrow for her lost
sweetheart had turned the child's brain.</p>

<p>'Do, father&mdash;do!' she urged, her thin brown
lips trembling with anxiety and with the sense
of her own powerlessness to move unless he
would consent.</p>

<p>Her father hid his face in his hands; he felt
helpless before her stronger will. She would
force him to do what she desired, he knew;
and he trembled, for he had neither knowledge
nor means to make such a journey as this would
be to the marshlands in the west, where Cecco
lay.</p>

<p>'And the tree&mdash;the tree!' he muttered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">338</a></span>
He had seen the tree so long by that little
square window, it was part of his life and hers.
The thought of its sale terrified him as if he
were going to sell some human friend into
bondage.</p>

<p>'There is no other way,' said Lizina sadly.</p>

<p>She, too, was loth to sell the tree, but they
had nothing else to sell; and the intense selfishness
of a fixed idea possessed her to the exclusion
of all other feeling.</p>

<p>Then the cough shook her once more from
head to foot, and a little froth of blood came to
her lips.</p>

<p>Lizina, in the double cruelty of her childhood
and of her ill-health, was merciless to her
father, and to the tree which had been her companion
so long. She was possessed by the
egotism of sorrow. She was a little thing, now
enfeebled and broken by long nights without
sleep and long days without food, and her heart
was set on this one idea, which she did not
reveal&mdash;that she would die down there, and that
then they would put her in the same ground
with him. This was her idea.</p>

<p>In the night she got up noiselessly, whilst
her father was for awhile sunk in the deep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">339</a></span>
sleep which comes after hard manual toil, and
came up to the lemon-tree and leaned her cheek
against its earthen vase.</p>

<p>'I am sorry to send you away, dearie,' she
said to it; 'but there is no other way to go
to him.'</p>

<p>She felt as if it must understand and must
feel wounded. Then she broke off a little
branch&mdash;a small one with a few flowers on it.</p>

<p>'That is for him,' she said to it.</p>

<p>And she stood there sleepily with the moonlight
pouring in on her and the lemon-tree
through the little square hole of the window.</p>

<p>When she got back to her bed she was
chilled to the bone, and she stuffed the rough
sacking of her coverture between her teeth to
stop the coughing, which might wake her father.
She had put the little branch of her lemon into
the broken pitcher which stood by her at night
to slake her thirst.</p>

<p>'Sell it, <i>babbo</i>, quick, quick!' she said in the
morning.</p>

<p>She was afraid her strength would not last
for the journey, but she did not say so. She
tried to seem cheerful. He thought her better.</p>

<p>'Sell it to-day&mdash;quick, quick!' she cried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">340</a></span>
feverishly; and she knew that she was cruel
and ungrateful, but she persisted in her cruelty
and ingratitude.</p>

<p>Her father, in despair, yielded.</p>

<p>It seemed to him as if he were cutting the
throat of a friend. Then he approached the
tree to carry it away. He had called in one of
his fellow-carters to help to move it, for it was
too heavy for one man. With difficulty it was
forced through the narrow, low door and down
the steep stair, its leaves brushing the walls with
a sighing sound, and its earthen jar grinding on
the stone of the steps. Lizina watched it go
without a sigh, without a tear. Her eyes were
dry and shining; her little body was quivering;
her face was red and pale in quick, uneven
changes.</p>

<p>'It goes where it will be better than with us,'
said Fringuello, in a vague apology to it, as he
lifted it out of the entrance of the house.</p>

<p>He had sold it to a gardener in a villa near
at hand.</p>

<p>'Oh yes, it will be better off,' he said
feverishly, in the doubtful yet aggressive tone of
one who argues that which he knows is not true.
'With rich people instead of poor; out in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">341</a></span>
fine garden half the year, and in a beautiful
airy wooden house all winter. Oh yes, it will
be much better off. Now it has grown so big
it was choked where it stood in my little place;
no light, no air, no sun, nothing which it
wanted. It will be much better off where it
goes; it will have rich, new earth and every
sort of care.'</p>

<p>'It has done well enough with you,' said his
comrade carelessly, as he helped to shove the
vase on to the hand-cart.</p>

<p>'Yes, yes,' said Fringuello impatiently, 'but
it will do better where it goes. It has grown
too big for a room. It would starve with me.'</p>

<p>'Well, it is your own business,' said the
other man.</p>

<p>'Yes, it is his own business,' said the neighbours,
who were standing to see it borne away
as if it were some rare spectacle. 'But the tree
was always there; and the money you get will
go,' they added, in their collective wisdom.</p>

<p>He took up the handles of the little cart and
placed the yoke of cord over his shoulders, and
began to drag it away. He bent his head down
very low so that the people should not see the
tears which were running down his cheeks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">342</a></span>
When he came back to his home he carried
its price in his hands&mdash;thirty francs in three
paper notes. He held them out to Lizina.</p>

<p>'All is well with it; it is to stand in a beautiful
place, close to falling water, half in shade,
half in sun, as it likes best. Oh, all is well
with it, dear! do not be afraid.' Then his
voice failed him, and he sobbed aloud.</p>

<p>The child took the money. She had a little
bundle in her hand, and she had put on the
only pair of shoes she possessed.</p>

<p>'Clean yourself, father, and come&mdash;come
quickly,' she said in a little hard, dry, panting
voice.</p>

<p>'Oh wait, wait, my angel!' he cried piteously
through his sobs.</p>

<p>I cannot wait,' said the child, 'not a
minute, not a minute. Clean yourself and
come.'</p>

<p>In an hour's time they were in the train.
The child did everything&mdash;found the railway-station,
asked the way, paid their fares, took
their seats, pushing her father hither and thither
as if he were a blind man. He was dumb with
terror and regret; he resisted nothing. Having
sold the tree, there seemed to him nothing left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">343</a></span>
for him to do. Lizina obeyed him no more&mdash;she
commanded.</p>

<p>People turned to look after this little sick
girl with death written on her face, who spoke
and moved with such feverish decision, and
dragged after her this thin dumb man, her
small lean hand shut with nervous force upon
his own. All the way she ate nothing; she
only drank thirstily of water whenever the train
stopped.</p>

<p>The novelty and strangeness of the transit,
the crowd, and haste, and noise, the unfamiliar
scenes, the pressure of unknown people, and
the stare of unknown eyes&mdash;all which was so
bewildering and terrible to her father, had no
effect upon her. All she thought of was to
get to the place of which the name was written
on the scrap of paper which she had shown at
the ticket-office, and which she continued to
show mutely to anyone who spoke to her. It
said everything to her; she thought it must
say everything to everyone else.</p>

<p>Nothing could alarm her or arrest her attention.
Her whole mind was set on her goal.</p>

<p>'Your little lady is very ill!' said more than
one in a crowded railway-waggon, where they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">344</a></span>
jammed one on to another, thick as herrings in
a barrel.</p>

<p>'Ay, ay, she is very ill,' he answered
stupidly; and they did not know whether he
was unfeeling or daft. He was dizzy and sick
with the unwonted motion of the train, the
choking dust, the giddy landscape which seemed
to run past him, earth and sky together; but
on Lizina they made no impression, except that
she coughed almost incessantly. She seemed
to ail nothing and to perceive nothing. He
was seized with a panic of dread lest they
should be taken in some wrong direction, even
out of the world altogether; dreaded fire, accident,
death, treachery; felt himself caught up
by strong, invisible hands, and whirled away,
the powers of heaven or hell alone knew where.
His awful fear grew on him every moment
greater and greater; and he would have given
his soul to be back safe on the sand of the river
at his home.</p>

<p>But Lizina neither showed nor felt any fear
whatever.</p>

<p>The journey took the whole day and part of
the ensuing night; for the slow cheap train by
which they travelled gave way to others, passed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">345</a></span>
hours motionless, thrust aside and forgotten,
and paused at every little station on the road.
They suffered from hunger and thirst, and heat
and draught, and fatigue and contusion, as the
poor cattle suffered in the trucks beside them.
But the child did not seem to feel either exhaustion
or pain, or to want anything except
to be there&mdash;to be there. The towns, the
mountains, the sea, the coast, all so strange
and wonderful to untravelled eyes, had no
wonder for her. She only wanted to get beyond
them, to where it was that Cecco lay.
Every now and then she opened her bundle and
looked at the little twig of the lemon-tree.</p>

<p>Alarmed at her aspect, and the racking cough,
their companions shrank away from them as far
as the crowding of the waggon allowed of, and
they were left unquestioned and undisturbed,
whilst the day wore on and the sun went down
into the sea and the evening deepened into
night.</p>

<p>It was dawn when they were told to descend;
they had reached their destination&mdash;a dull, sun-baked,
fever-stricken little port, with the salt
water on one side of it, and the <i>machia</i> and
marsh on the other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">346</a></span>
Lizina got down from the train, holding her
little bundle in one hand and in the other her
father's wrist. Their limbs were bruised, aching,
trembling, their spines felt broken, their heads
seemed like empty bladders, in which their
brains went round and round; but she did not
faint or fall&mdash;she went straight onward as though
the place was familiar to her.</p>

<p>Close to the desolate, sand-strewn station there
was a fort of decaying yellow stone, high walls
with loopholes, mounds of sand with sea-thistle
and bryony growing in them; before these was
the blue water, and a long stone wall running
far out into the water. To the iron rings in it a
few fisher boats were moored by their cables.
The sun was rising over the inland wilderness,
where wild boars and buffalo dwelt under impenetrable
thickets. Lizina led her father by
the hand past the fortifications to a little desolate
church with crumbling belfry, where she
knew the burial-ground must be. There were
four lime-washed walls, with a black iron door,
through the bars of which the graves within and
the rank grass around them could be seen.
The gate was locked; the child sat down on a
stone before it and waited. She motioned to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">347</a></span>
her father to do the same. He was like a poor
steer landed after a long voyage in which he
has neither eaten nor drank, but has been
bruised, buffeted, thrown to and fro, galled,
stunned, tormented. They waited, as she wished,
in the cool dust of the breaking day. The bell
above in the church steeple was tolling for the
first Mass.</p>

<p>In a little while a sacristan came out of the
presbytery near the church, and began to turn
a great rusty key in the church door. He saw
the two sitting there by the graveyard, and
looking at them over his shoulder, said to them,
'You are strangers&mdash;what would you?'</p>

<p>Lizina rose and answered him: 'Will you
open to me? I come to see my Cecco, who
lies here. I have something to give him.'</p>

<p>The sacristan looked at her father.</p>

<p>'Cecco?' he repeated, in a doubtful tone.</p>

<p>'A lad of Royezzano, a soldier who died
here,' said Fringuello, hoarsely and faintly, for
his throat was parched and swollen, and his
head swam. 'He and my child were playmates.
Canst tell us, good man, where his
grave is made?'</p>

<p>The sacristan paused, standing before the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">348</a></span>
leathern curtain of the church porch, trying to
remember. Save for soldiers and the fisher
folk, there was no one who either lived or died
there; his mind went back over the winter and
autumn months, to the last summer, in which
the marsh fever and the pestilential drought had
made many sicken and some die in the fort and
in the town.</p>

<p>'Cecco? Cecco?' he said doubtfully. 'A
Tuscan lad? A conscript? Ay, I do recall
him now. He got the tertian fever and died in
barracks. His reverence wrote about him to his
family. Yes, I remember. There were three
soldier lads died last year, all in the summer.
There are three crosses where they lie. I put
them there; his is the one nearest the wall.
Yes, you can go in; I have the key.'</p>

<p>He stepped across the road and unlocked the
gate. He looked wonderingly on Lizina as he
did so. 'Poor little one!' he muttered, in
compassion. 'How small, how ill, to come so
far!'</p>

<p>Neither she nor her father seemed to hear
him. The child pressed through the aperture
as soon as the door was drawn ajar, and
Fringuello followed her. The burial-ground<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">349</a></span>
was small and crowded, covered with rank grass,
and here and there sea-lavender was growing.
The sacristan led them to a spot by the western
wall where there were three rude crosses made
of unbarked sticks nailed across one another.
The rank grass was growing amongst the clods
of sun-baked yellow clay; the high white wall
rose behind the crossed sticks; the sun beat
down on the place: there was nothing else.</p>

<p>The sacristan motioned to the cross nearest
the wall, and then went back to the church,
being in haste, as it was late for matins. Lizina
stood by the two poor rude sticks, once branches
of the hazel, which were all that marked the
grave of Cecco.</p>

<p>Her father, uncovering his head, fell on his
knees.</p>

<p>The child's face was illuminated with a strange
and holy rapture. She kissed the lemon bough
which she held in her hand, and then laid it
gently down upon the grass and clay under the
wall.</p>

<p>'I have remembered, dear,' she said softly,
and knelt on the ground and joined her hands
in prayer. Then the weakness of her body
overcame the strength of her spirit; she leaned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">350</a></span>
forward lower and lower until her face was
bowed over the yellow grass. 'I came to lie
with you,' she said under her breath; and then
her lips parted more widely with a choking
sigh, the blood gushed from her mouth, and in
a few minutes she was dead.</p>

<p>They laid her there in the clay and the sand
and the tussocks of grass, and her father went
back alone to his native place and empty
room.</p>

<div class="tb">*<span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>One day on the river-bank a man said to
him:</p>

<p>'It is odd, but that lemon-tree which you
sold to my master never did well; it died
within the week&mdash;a fine, strong, fresh young
tree. Were there worms at its root, think you,
or did the change to the open air kill it?'</p>

<p>Fringuello, who had always had a scared,
wild, dazed look on his face since he returned
from the sea-coast, looked at the speaker
stupidly, not with any wonder, but like one
who hears what he has long known but only
imperfectly understands.</p>

<p>'It knew Lizina was dead,' he said simply;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">351</a></span>
and then thrust his spade into the sand and
dug.</p>

<p>He would never smile nor sing any more,
nor any more know any joys of life; but he
still worked on from that habit which is the
tyrant and saviour of the poor.</p>
